  Abstract                 = {Deterministic and fuzzy verification methods are compared to assess the Quantitative Precipitation Forecasts (QPF) performance of an hierarchy of models run at Météo-France: two operational models (ARPEGE and ALADIN) and a prototype version of the high resolution model AROME. The reference data are 24-h accumulated rainfall values measured by the French climatological network of rain gauges. The deterministic forecasts are converted to frequencies of threshold exceedence in a neighbourhood in order to apply a fuzzy verification method, able to determine the influence of the double penalty. Local and regional versions of the Brier skill score (BSS) are computed and persistence is the selected reference system. An optimal size of the neighbourhood can be determined from the local version of the BSS. The regional version of the BSS increases with the size of the neighbourhood and provides useful information on the reduction of the error for large scales. All the scores show that the ALADIN 3DVAR implementation improves the quality of the ALADIN QPF in comparison to the ARPEGE QPF. Deterministic verification methods show that AROME improves the QPF for weak precipitation but produces too many false alarms for heavy rain. Moreover, the fuzzy approach removes more substantially the double penalty for the heavy rain forecasts of AROME than for the light precipitation of ALADIN. After recalibration the ALADIN QPF have better deterministic scores than the AROME QPF. Nevertheless, fuzzy verification methods prove the contrary: for scales larger than 50 km, the AROME scores exceed the ALADIN scores, but not significantly.

  Abstract                 = {Ensemble filters are used in many data assimilation applications in geophysics. Basic implementations of ensemble filters are trivial but are susceptible to errors from many sources. Model error, sampling error and fundamental inconsistencies between the filter assumptions and reality combine to produce assimilations that are suboptimal or suffer from filter divergence. Several auxiliary algorithms have been developed to help filters tolerate these errors. For instance, covariance inflation combats the tendency of ensembles to have insufficient variance by increasing the variance during the assimilation. The amount of inflation is usually determined by trial and error. It is possible, however, to design Bayesian algorithms that determine the inflation adaptively. A spatially and temporally varying adaptive inflation algorithm is described. A normally distributed inflation random variable is associated with each element of the model state vector. Adaptive inflation is demonstrated in two low-order model experiments. In the first, the dominant error source is small ensemble sampling error. In the second, the model error is dominant. The adaptive inflation assimilations have better mean and variance estimates than other inflation methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Good performance with small ensemble filters applied to models with many state variables may require [`]localizing' the impact of an observation to state variables that are [`]close' to the observation. As a step in developing nearly generic ensemble filter assimilation systems, a method to estimate [`]localization' functions is presented. Localization is viewed as a means to ameliorate sampling error when small ensembles are used to sample the statistical relation between an observation and a state variable. The impact of spurious sample correlations between an observation and model state variables is estimated using a [`]hierarchical ensemble filter', where an ensemble of ensemble filters is used to detect sampling error. Hierarchical filters can adapt to a wide array of ensemble sizes and observational error characteristics with only limited heuristic tuning. Hierarchical filters can allow observations to efficiently impact state variables, even when the notion of [`]distance' between the observation and the state variables cannot be easily defined. For instance, defining the distance between an observation of radar reflectivity from a particular radar and beam angle taken at 1133 GMT and a model temperature variable at 700 hPa 60 km north of the radar beam at 1200 GMT is challenging. The hierarchical filter estimates sampling error from a [`]group' of ensembles and computes a factor between 0 and 1 to minimize sampling error. An a priori notion of distance is not required. Results are shown in both a low-order model and a simple atmospheric GCM. For low-order models, the hierarchical filter produces [`]localization' functions that are very similar to those already described in the literature. When observations are more complex or taken at different times from the state specification (in ensemble smoothers for instance), the localization functions become increasingly distinct from those used previously. In the GCM, this complexity reaches a level that suggests that it would be difficult to define efficient localization functions a priori. There is a cost trade-off between running hierarchical filters or running a traditional filter with larger ensemble size. Hierarchical filters can be run for short training periods to develop localization statistics that can be used in a traditional ensemble filter to produce high quality assimilations at reasonable cost, even when the relation between observations and state variables is not well-known a priori. Additional research is needed to determine if it is ever cost-efficient to run hierarchical filters for large data assimilation problems instead of traditional filters with the corresponding total number of ensemble members.},

  Abstract                 = {Many methods using ensemble integrations of prediction models as integral parts of data assimilation have appeared in the atmospheric and oceanic literature. In general, these methods have been derived from the Kalman filter and have been known as ensemble Kalman filters. A more general class of methods including these ensemble Kalman filter methods is derived starting from the nonlinear filtering problem. When working in a joint state?observation space, many features of ensemble filtering algorithms are easier to derive and compare. The ensemble filter methods derived here make a (local) least squares assumption about the relation between prior distributions of an observation variable and model state variables. In this context, the update procedure applied when a new observation becomes available can be described in two parts. First, an update increment is computed for each prior ensemble estimate of the observation variable by applying a scalar ensemble filter. Second, a linear regression of the prior ensemble sample of each state variable on the observation variable is performed to compute update increments for each state variable ensemble member from corresponding observation variable increments. The regression can be applied globally or locally using Gaussian kernel methods. Several previously documented ensemble Kalman filter methods, the perturbed observation ensemble Kalman filter and ensemble adjustment Kalman filter, are developed in this context. Some new ensemble filters that extend beyond the Kalman filter context are also discussed. The two-part method can provide a computationally efficient implementation of ensemble filters and allows more straightforward comparison of methods since they differ only in the solution of a scalar filtering problem.},

  Abstract                 = {A theory for estimating the probability distribution of the state of a model given a set of observations exists. This nonlinear filtering theory unifies the data assimilation and ensemble generation problem that have been key foci of prediction and predictability research for numerical weather and ocean prediction applications. A new algorithm, referred to as an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter, and the more traditional implementation of the ensemble Kalman filter in which &#8220;perturbed observations&#8221; are used, are derived as Monte Carlo approximations to the nonlinear filter. Both ensemble Kalman filter methods produce assimilations with small ensemble mean errors while providing reasonable measures of uncertainty in the assimilated variables. The ensemble methods can assimilate observations with a nonlinear relation to model state variables and can also use observations to estimate the value of imprecisely known model parameters. These ensemble filter methods are shown to have significant advantages over four-dimensional variational assimilation in low-order models and scale easily to much larger applications. Heuristic modifications to the filtering algorithms allow them to be applied efficiently to very large models by sequentially processing observations and computing the impact of each observation on each state variable in an independent calculation. The ensemble adjustment Kalman filter is applied to a nondivergent barotropic model on the sphere to demonstrate the capabilities of the filters in models with state spaces that are much larger than the ensemble size.When observations are assimilated in the traditional ensemble Kalman filter, the resulting updated ensemble has a mean that is consistent with the value given by filtering theory, but only the expected value of the covariance of the updated ensemble is consistent with the theory. The ensemble adjustment Kalman filter computes a linear operator that is applied to the prior ensemble estimate of the state, resulting in an updated ensemble whose mean and also covariance are consistent with the theory. In the cases compared here, the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter performs significantly better than the traditional ensemble Kalman filter, apparently because noise introduced into the assimilated ensemble through perturbed observations in the traditional filter limits its relative performance. This superior performance may not occur for all problems and is expected to be most notable for small ensembles. Still, the results suggest that careful study of the capabilities of different varieties of ensemble Kalman filters is appropriate when exploring new applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Knowledge of the probability distribution of initial conditions is central to almost all practical studies of predictability and to improvements in stochastic prediction of the atmosphere. Traditionally, data assimilation for atmospheric predictability or prediction experiments has attempted to find a single &#8220;best&#8221; estimate of the initial state. Additional information about the initial condition probability distribution is then obtained primarily through heuristic techniques that attempt to generate representative perturbations around the best estimate. However, a classical theory for generating an estimate of the complete probability distribution of an initial state given a set of observations exists. This nonlinear filtering theory can be applied to unify the data assimilation and ensemble generation problem and to produce superior estimates of the probability distribution of the initial state of the atmosphere (or ocean) on regional or global scales. A Monte Carlo implementation of the fully nonlinear filter has been developed and applied to several low-order models. The method is able to produce assimilations with small ensemble mean errors while also providing random samples of the initial condition probability distribution. The Monte Carlo method can be applied in models that traditionally require the application of initialization techniques without any explicit initialization. Initial application to larger models is promising, but a number of challenges remain before the method can be extended to large realistic forecast models.},

  Abstract                 = {Adaptive bias corrections for satellite radiances need to separate the observation bias from the systematic errors in the background in order to prevent the analysis from drifting towards its own climate. The variational bias correction scheme (VarBC) is a particular adaptive scheme that is embedded inside the assimilation system.VarBC is compared with an offline adaptive and a static bias correction scheme. In simulation, the three schemes are exposed to artificial shifts in the observations and the background. The VarBC scheme can be considered as a good compromise between the static and the offline adaptive schemes. It shows some skill in distinguishing between the background-error and the observation biases when other unbiased observations are available to anchor the system. Tests of VarBC in a real numerical weather prediction (NWP) environment show a significant reduction in the misfit with radiosonde observations (especially in the stratosphere) due to NWP model error. The scheme adapts to an instrument error with only minimal disruption to the analysis.In VarBC, the bias is constrained by the fit to observationsâsuch as radiosondesâthat are not bias-corrected to the NWP model. In parts of the atmosphere where no radiosonde observations are available, the radiosonde network still imposes an indirect constraint on the system, which can be enhanced by applying a mask to VarBC.

It is shown how forecast error statistics appear in the data assimilation problem through the background error covariance matrix, B. The mathematical and physical properties of the covariances are surveyed in relation to a number of leading systems that are in use for operational weather forecasting. Different studies emphasize different aspects of B, and the known ways that B can impact the assimilation are brought together. Treating B practically in data assimilation is problematic. One such problem is in the numerical measurement of B, and five calibration methods are reviewed, including analysis of innovations, analysis of forecast differences and ensemble methods. Another problem is the prohibitive size of B. This needs special treatment in data assimilation, and is covered in a companion article (Part II). Examples are drawn from the literature that show the univariate and multivariate structure of the B-matrix, in terms of variances and correlations, which are interpreted in terms of the properties of the atmosphere. The need for an accurate quantification of forecast error statistics is emphasized. Copyright © 2008 Royal Meteorological Society},

  Abstract                 = {This article reviews a range of leading methods to model the background error covariance matrix (the B-matrix) in modern variational data assimilation systems. Owing partly to its very large rank, the B-matrix is impossible to use in an explicit fashion in an operational setting and so methods have been sought to model its important properties in a practical way. Because the B-matrix is such an important component of a data assimilation system, a large effort has been made in recent years to improve its formulation. Operational variational assimilation systems use a form of control variable transform to model B. This transform relates variables that exist in the assimilation's lsquocontrol spacersquo to variables in the forecast model's physical space. The mathematical basis on which the control variable transform allows the B-matrix to be modelled is reviewed from first principles, and examples of existing transforms are brought together from the literature. The method allows a large rank matrix to be represented by a relatively small number of parameters, and it is shown how information that is not provided explicitly is filled in. Methods use dynamical properties of the atmosphere (e.g. balance relationships) and make assumptions about the way that background errors are spatially correlated (e.g. homogeneity and isotropy in the horizontal). It is also common to assume that the B-matrix is static. The way that these, and other, assumptions are built into systems is shown.The article gives an example of how a current method performs. An important part of this article is a discussion of some new ideas that have been proposed to improve the method. Examples include how a more appropriate use of balance relations can be made, how errors in the moist variables can be treated and how assumptions of homogeneity/isotropy and the otherwise static property of the B-matrix can be relaxed. Key developments in the application of dynamics, wavelets, recursive filters and flow-dependent methods are reviewed. The article ends with a round up of the methods and a discussion of future challenges that the field will need to address. Copyright © 2008 Royal Meteorological Society},

  Abstract                 = {This paper develops a representation for the three-dimensional covariance structure of the observed residuals, or differences, between the short-range forecasts used as trial fields in an operational data assimilation system and the verifying radiosonde data. Assuming homogeneity and isotropy on pressure surfaces, geopotential and wind covariances are fitted to a series expansion employing Bessel functions in the horizontal and vertical normal modes as basis functions. The latter are obtained from linear model equations with an isothermal basic state employing a log-pressure vertical coordinate. Such a formulation allows for a closed analytic form, and therefore a spatially continuous three-dimensional covariance model. The model is used to examine covariances of geopotential as well as transverse and longitudinal wind components. Unlike commonly-used representations employing vertical/horizontal separability, the present model reproduces the observed significant increase of horizontal decorrelation length scales with height. The wind data are used to obtain divergent and solenoidal components and subsequent comparison of stream function and geopotential statistics reveals a high degree of geostrophic balance away from the upper and lower boundaries. It is suggested that the present mathematical framework could be employed in developing analytical non-separable three-dimensional correlation functions for use in operational data assimilation.},

  Abstract                 = {Variational data assimilation systems require the specification of the covariances of background and observation errors. Although the specification of the background-error covariances has been the subject of intense research, current operational data assimilation systems still rely on essentially static and thus flow-independent background-error covariances. At least theoretically, it is possible to use flow-dependent background-error covariances in four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVAR) through exploiting the connection between variational data assimilation and estimation theory. This paper reports on investigations concerning the impact of flow-dependent background-error covariances in an idealized 4DVAR system that, based on quasigeostrophic dynamics, assimilates artificial observations. The main emphasis is placed on quantifying the improvement in analysis quality that is achievable in 4DVAR through the use of flow-dependent background-error covariances. Flow dependence is achieved through dynamical error-covariance evolution based on singular vectors in a reduced-rank approach, referred to as reduced-rank Kalman filter (RRKF). The RRKF yields partly dynamic background-error covariances through blending static and dynamic information, where the dynamic information is obtained from error evolution in a subspace of dimension k (defined here through the singular vectors) that may be small compared to the dimension of the model?s phase space n, which is equal to 1449 in the system investigated here. The results show that the use of flow-dependent background-error covariances based on the RRKF leads to improved analyses compared to a system using static background-error statistics. That latter system uses static background-error covariances that are carefully tuned given the model dynamics and the observational information available. It is also shown that the performance of the RRKF approaches the performance of the extended Kalman filter, as k approaches n. Results therefore support the hypothesis that significant analysis improvement is possible through the use of flow-dependent background-error covariances given that a sufficiently large number (here on the order of n/10) of singular vectors is used.},

  Abstract                 = {Ensemble Kalman filter techniques are widely used to assimilate observations into dynamical models. The phase-space dimension is typically much larger than the number of ensemble members, which leads to inaccurate results in the computed covariance matrices. These inaccuracies can lead, among other things, to spurious long-range correlations, which can be eliminated by Schur-product-based localization techniques. In this article, we propose a new technique for implementing such localization techniques within the class of ensemble transform/square-root Kalman filters. Our approach relies on a continuous embedding of the Kalman filter update for the ensemble members, i.e. we state an ordinary differential equation (ODE) with solutions that, over a unit time interval, are equivalent to the Kalman filter update. The ODE formulation forms a gradient system with the observations as a cost functional. Besides localization, the new ODE ensemble formulation should also find useful application in the context of nonlinear observation operators and observations that arrive continuously in time.

  Abstract                 = {Three error simulation techniques are compared formally, in particular regarding their representation of the analysis step. The associated results are moreover examined for the Aladin-France limited-area model, which is coupled with the Arpège global model. It is first shown that the analysis error equation involves the same operators as the analysis equation. This implies that the analysis ensemble approach is appropriate, as the analysis equation is used to transform the background and observation dispersions into the analysis dispersion. By contrast, the standard NMC method relies essentially on the analysis increment equation, which contributes to a large extent to the excessive emphasis on the large-scale structures. The so-called lagged NMC method is shown to be closely related to the Arpège/Aladin model differences. The analysis ensemble approach gives error spectra that are intermediate between those of the two other methods. This is in agreement with the representation of the initial and lateral boundary uncertainties, in a way that is consistent with the influence of the analysis equation and with the short forecast ranges.},

Non-adaptive moderation or localization functions are widely used in ensemble DA to reduce the amplitude of spurious ensemble correlations. These functions are inappropriate (1) if true error correlation functions move a comparable distance to the localization length scale over the time window and/or (2) if the widths of true error correlation functions are highly flow dependent. A method for generating localization functions that move with the true error correlation functions and that also adapt to the width of the true error correlation function is given. The method uses ensemble correlations raised to a power (ECO-RAP). A gallery of periodic one-dimensional error models is used to show how the method uses error propagation information and error correlation width information retained by powers of raw ensemble correlations to propagate and adaptively adjust the width of the localization function. It is found that ECO-RAP localization outperforms non-adaptive localization when the true errors are propagating or the error correlation length scale is varying and is as good as non-adaptive localization when such variations in error covariance structure are absent.},

Because brute force incorporation would be too expensive, we demonstrate a factorization property for Part 1's Covariances Adaptively Localized with ECO-rap (CALECO) forecast error covariance matrix that, together with other simplifications, reduces the cost. The property inexpensively provides a large CALECO ensemble whose covariance is the CALECO matrix. Each member of the CALECO ensemble is an element-wise product between one raw ensemble member and one column of the square root of the ECO-RAP matrix. The LETKF is applied to the CALECO ensemble rather than the raw ensemble. The approach enables the update of large numbers of variables within each observation volume at little additional computational cost. Under plausible assumptions, this makes the CALECO and standard LETKF costs similar. The CALECO LETKF does not require artificial observation error inflation or vertically confined observation volumes both of which confound the assimilation of non-local observations such as satellite observations. Using a 27 member ensemble from a global Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) system, we depict four-dimensional (4-D) flow-adaptive error covariance localization and test the ability of the CALECO LETKF to reduce analysis error.},

  Abstract                 = {Many ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation (DA) schemes reduce the effect of spurious ensemble correlations caused by small ensemble size by multiplying the correlations by moderation functions. Moderation functions envelop true error correlation functions. Ideal moderation functions would adapt to variations in the movement and width of true error correlation functions. Here, we describe a new method in which flow-dependent moderation functions are built from powers of smoothed ensemble correlations. The approach imparts to the moderation function movement and width information retained by the smoothed ensemble correlations. Spurious smoothed ensemble correlations are attenuated by raising them to a power. Simple systems were used to compare DA performance using such Smoothed ENsemble COrrelations Raised to a Power (SENCORP) moderation functions against DA performance using optimally tuned but non-adaptive moderation functions. The simple systems considered feature propagating error correlation functions and error correlation functions with variable width. It was found that when significant spatio-temporal variations in the true error correlation function are present, SENCORP moderation functions are superior to non-adaptive moderation functions. In the absence of spatio-temporal variations, the DA performance of SENCORP moderation functions was found to be statistically indistinguishable from the DA performance of non-adaptive moderation functions. An example using a primitive equation global model is given to illustrate how the method could be used to improve the performance of a local ensemble Kalman filter/smoother, particularly when larger observation volumes are used, to better account for error propagation and/or observations that represent vertically averaged variables.

We show that the new system is beneficial in terms of deterministic forecast skill, provided that random and systematic errors in the estimation of variances are properly accounted for. The mechanisms through which EDA sample variances influence the deterministic analysis are clarified. An interesting aspect is that the use of flow-dependent variances alone is able to introduce a significant degree of flow dependency in the analysis increments. Further possible improvements and extensions to the current methodology are also discussed. Copyright © 2012 Royal Meteorological Society},

  Abstract                 = {Ensemble of data assimilations (EDA) methods have been shown to be able to provide flow-dependent estimates of analysis and background error statistics. For this reason, they potentially present a way to overcome one of the main limitations of current variational data assimilation systems. However, the limited number of ensemble members which can be realistically run in an operational context and the stochastic nature of the EDA approach lead to high levels of sampling noise in the relevant ensemble statistics. To answer this problem, an âobjective filteringâ technique of the sample ensemble variances proposed by Raynaud et al. in 2009 has been implemented at ECMWF. In this article we present a comparison of the ability of ensemble data assimilation systems of different sizes (10 to 50 members) to represent flow-dependent background-error variances. In particular, the ensemble-based variances are examined in the cases of the severe storm Klaus (24 January 2009) over France and the Atlantic tropical hurricane Ike (1-14 September 2008). Our results show that, while a relatively small ensemble (10 members) can be sufficient to resolve the larger-scale error structures connected to an extratropical cyclogenesis, a larger ensemble is beneficial to resolve more localised anomalies like those connected with a hurricane. In this sense, the objective filtering technique provides a useful indication of the spatial scales the ensemble is able to resolve in a statistically robust way.The day-to-day variability of the ensemble statistics and how this affects the objective spatial filtering procedure are also examined. Our conclusion is that a time-independent implementation of the filter based on a climatology of truncation wave numbers results in more robust ensemble statistics estimates, and ultimately in improved forecast skill scores.

The methods used are the so-called Hollingsworth/LÃ¶nnberg method, a method based on subtracting a scaled version of mapped assumed background errors from first-guess departure covariances and the Desroziers diagnostic. The present article reports the results for the three Advanced TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (ATOVS) instruments: the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU)-A, High-Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) and Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS).The findings suggest that all AMSU-A sounding channels show little or no interchannel or spatial observation-error correlations, except for surface-sensitive channels over land. Estimates for the observation error are mostly close to the instrument noise. In contrast, HIRS temperature-sounding channels exhibit some interchannel error correlations, and these are stronger for surface-sensitive channels. There are also indications for stronger spatial-error correlations for the HIRS short-wave channels. There is good agreement between the estimates from the three methods for temperature-sounding channels.Estimating observation errors for humidity-sounding channels of MHS and HIRS appears more difficult. A considerable proportion of the observation error for humidity-sounding channels appears correlated spatially for short separation distances, as well as between channels. Observation error estimates for humidity channels are generally considerably larger than the instrument noise.Observation error estimates from this study are consistently lower than those assumed in the ECMWF assimilation system. As error correlations are small for AMSU-A, the study suggests that the current use of AMSU-A data in the ECMWF system in terms of observation-error or thinning-scale choices is fairly conservative.

The present article reports the results for the high-spectral-resolution Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI).The findings suggest that mid-tropospheric to stratospheric temperature-sounding channels for AIRS and IASI show little or no interchannel or spatial observation-error correlations, and estimates for the observation error are close to the instrument noise. Channels with stronger sensitivity to the surface show larger observation errors compared with the instrument noise, and some of this error is correlated spatially and between channels. Short-wave temperature-sounding channels also appear more prone to spatial observation-error correlations. The three methods show good consistency for these estimates.Estimation of observation errors for humidity-sounding channels appears more difficult. A considerable proportion of the observation error for humidity-sounding channels appears to be correlated spatially for short separation distances, as well as between channels. Observation-error estimates for humidity channels are generally considerably larger than the instrument noise.An analysis of departure statistics and observation-error correlations by scan position and scan-line difference for IASI shows a pattern that correlates with the direction of the movement of IASI's corner cube mirror. The effect is very small and most likely linked to micro-vibrations of IASI's beam-splitter.The statistics also provide information on the assumed background errors. There are indications that the assumed background errors for tropospheric temperature are inflated (by about 30\% 60\%), whereas there is little indication for background-error inflation for stratospheric temperatures.

In probabilistic terms, the AROME-EPS ensemble performs better than the AROME-France deterministic prediction system, and a state-of-the-art ensemble at a lower resolution. The strengths and weaknesses of AROME-EPS are discussed. Here, impact experiments are used to study perturbation schemes for the initial conditions and the model surface. Both have a significant effect on the ensemble performance. The interactions between the perturbations of lateral boundaries, initial conditions and surface perturbations are studied. The consistency between initial and lateral perturbations is found to be unimportant from a meteorological point of view. Ensemble data assimilation is not as effective as a simpler surface perturbation scheme, and it is noted that both approaches could be usefully combined.},

  Abstract                 = {The Met Office is currently developing an ensemble-based data-assimilation system for use in numerical weather prediction (NWP). In an effort to inform those developments, a simple model has been used to compare a number of different flavours of ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). As in many previous studies, deterministic (square-root) filters are seen to perform better than stochastic (perturbed-observations) filters. Two previously proposed methods for mitigating the effects of perturbing the observations were tested. These modified stochastic filters improved performance, but were still worse than the deterministic filters. Very little difference was seen between the performance of the various deterministic filters tested.The typical approach to localization in the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF) is based solely on the distance between each observation and the model point being updated. It takes no account of the inter-observation distance and we argue that this is incorrect. However, the difference between covariance localization and observation localization is only relevant when the assimilation is not weak and hence it did not affect performance in these tests. If a hybrid covariance matrix is used to update the ‘deterministic’ forecast around which the ensemble is centred, then using the same covariance matrix when updating the perturbations is seen to be beneficial in a stochastic filter. This is not the case in the square-root filter, due to restrictions imposed by its formulation. Tests with a nonlinear observation operator indicate better behaviour when observations are assimilated simultaneously rather than sequentially. An ensemble of variational minimizations has some advantages in this situation. These results, along with other considerations, have led the Met Office to develop a 4-dimensional ensemble-variational (4D-En-Var) system for data assimilation and ensemble generation.},

Static background-error covariances are calculated for the 3D-Var using differences between AROME forecasts from an ensemble data assimilation. In this study, the covariance calculation is generalized in order to estimate time-dependent background-error covariances. A six-member ensemble is shown to provide robust covariance estimates in the context of the considered homogeneous covariance formulation. There is significant day-to-day variability in the variances, autocorrelations, and cross-correlations of background errors. This variability is linked to the meteorological conditions over the AROME-France model domain. The benefits of using flow-dependent background-error covariances, instead of static ones, are shown using assimilation diagnostics and measures of forecast performance.

It uses a 3D-Var assimilation scheme to determine its initial conditions. Climatological background-error covariances of such a system are calculated using differences between forecasts from an AROME ensemble assimilation. These statistics are compared with the lower-resolution ALADIN-France system ones: they provide 3D-Var analysis increments that are more intense and more localized, in accordance with the actual AROME model resolution.AROME ensemble-assimilation (ENS_DA) covariances have also been compared with covariances calculated with an AROME ensemble of forecasts run in spin-up mode (ENS_SU). On the one hand, ENS_SU appears to be a reasonable approximation of ENS_DA compared with ALADIN-France covariances, by representing a large part of the small-scale variance increase. On the other hand, ENS_DA allows for a fully cycled development of small-scale forecast perturbations, which leads to a further enhancement of small-scale covariances. This aspect is shown to be beneficial in terms of assimilation diagnostics and forecast performance and in a case study. Copyright © 2011 Royal Meteorological Society},

In addition to conventional and satellite observations, regional high-resolution observations are assimilated, such as screen-level observations, total zenith delays from ground-based GPS stations and radar measurements (radial winds and reflectivities). The impact of the various observation types on AROME-France analyses is assessed using an a posteriori diagnostic, the reduction of the estimation error variance. This diagnostic, estimated using a randomization technique, allows one to investigate observation impact depending on the control variable field, model levels, date, analysis time, and spatial scales considered. This highlights the importance of screen-level observations (2 m temperature and relative humidity, 10 m wind) for the lowest layers, of aircraft measurements for temperature and wind field analyses and of radar observations for wind and specific humidity in middle and high troposphere. Only the last mentioned observations appear to be informative regarding the horizontal length-scale below 200 km, while all observations are mostly informative for length-scales above 200 km. The results from two diagnostics, namely the variance reduction and the Degrees of Freedom for Signal (DFS), are compared and found to be largely similar. The variance reduction appears to be an interesting diagnostic to improve the understanding of how observations are used.},

  Abstract                 = {An axisymmetric numerical model is used to evaluate the maximum possible intensity of tropical cyclones. As compared with traditionally formulated nonhydrostatic models, this new model has improved mass and energy conservation in saturated conditions. In comparison with the axisymmetric model developed by Rotunno and Emanuel, the new model produces weaker cyclones (by &#8764;10&#37;, in terms of maximum azimuthal velocity); the difference is attributable to several approximations in the Rotunno&#8211;Emanuel model. Then, using a single specification for initial conditions (with a sea surface temperature of 26&#176;C), the authors conduct model sensitivity tests to determine the sensitivity of maximum azimuthal velocity (&#965;max) to uncertain aspects of the modeling system. For fixed mixing lengths in the turbulence parameterization, a converged value of &#965;max is achieved for radial grid spacing of order 1 km and vertical grid spacing of order 250 m. The fall velocity of condensate (Vt) changes &#965;max by up to 60&#37;, and the largest &#965;max occurs for pseudoadiabatic thermodynamics (i.e., for Vt &#62; 10 m s&#8722;1). The sensitivity of &#965;max to the ratio of surface exchange coefficients for entropy and momentum (CE/CD) matches the theoretical result, &#965;max &#8764; (CE/CD)1/2, for nearly inviscid flow, but simulations with increasing turbulence intensity show less dependence on CE/CD; this result suggests that the effect of CE/CD is less important than has been argued previously. The authors find that &#965;max is most sensitive to the intensity of turbulence in the radial direction. However, some settings, such as inviscid flow, yield clearly unnatural structures; for example, &#965;max exceeds 110 m s&#8722;1, despite a maximum observed intensity of &#8764;70 m s&#8722;1 for this environment. The authors show that turbulence in the radial direction limits maximum axisymmetric intensity by weakening the radial gradients of angular momentum (which prevents environmental air from being drawn to small radius) and of entropy (which is consistent with weaker intensity by consideration of thermal wind balance). It is also argued that future studies should consider parameterized turbulence as an important factor in simulated tropical cyclone intensity.},

  Abstract                 = {In this study several approaches for obtaining more accurate background-error covariances for atmospheric data assimilation are evaluated. Experiments are conducted by replacing the covariances in the operational three-dimensional variational analysis system at the Canadian Meteorological Centre. In the current system, these covariances are computed using the so-called NMC method that is known to suffer from several deficiencies. The approaches evaluated in this study attempt to more realistically sample the probability distribution of background error by simulating (using a Monte Carlo approach) the error generated at each stage of the forecast-analysis process. The ensemble Kalman filter and a simpler approach applied to an existing forecast-analysis system are both used to generate these error samples. In addition, error samples are generated directly from the covariances of the operational system to allow the effects of sampling error to be quantified. Several strategies for estimating the full covariance matrix from a relatively small number of error samples are then employed. Approaches include the use of a spatially localized ensemble representation of the correlations that allows the usual assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy to be relaxed. In addition, the use of a weighted average between such a covariance matrix and a covariance matrix with homogeneous and isotropic correlations is evaluated. Several diagnostic results from the estimated background-error covariances are presented in addition to verification statistics computed from two-week forecast-analysis experiments. Modest forecast improvements are obtained by using the new background-error covariance estimates, mostly in the southern hemisphere. However, additional results suggest that further improvements may be gained by increasing the number of error samples and a preliminary quantitative estimate of the expected gain is computed. © Crown copyright, 2005.

  Abstract                 = {In this study, the localization of background-error correlations in both the spectral and the spatial domains is examined. While spatial localization has become a standard approach for reducing the sampling error of background-error correlations, localization of spectral correlations has not yet been fully explored. It is shown that spectral localization results in a spatial smoothing of the correlation functions in grid-point space. The use of correlations that are diagonal in spectral space, resulting in globally homogeneous correlations, has been frequently employed with data assimilation applications for numerical weather prediction (NWP). More recently, correlations that are diagonal in the space defined by an expansion of wavelet functions have been used to implicitly localize the correlations in a particular way in both spectral and grid-point spaces simultaneously. In this study, the explicit localization of correlations by varying amounts in both the spatial and the spectral domains is applied, to evaluate their complementary ability to reduce sampling error.Spectral and spatial localization are first applied to an idealized one-dimensional problem where the true correlations are known. In this context it is found that there is an optimal combination of spectral and spatial localization that minimizes the sampling error for a given ensemble of error realizations. Then the implementation of spectral localization is demonstrated in both a realistic three-dimensional variational assimilation system for NWP and an ensemble-based data assimilation system applied to an idealized model of the atmosphere's mesoscale dynamics. Two very different practical approaches are used to implement spectral localization for these two types of data assimilation systems. For the application to the ensemble-based data assimilation system, spectral localization is shown to systematically reduce analysis error without requiring additional model forecasts to be performed.

In an EnKF experiment having the same spatial resolution as the inner loop in the four-dimensional variational data assimilation system (4D-Var), the mean of each analysis ensemble is used to initialize the higher-resolution deterministic forecasts. Five different variational data assimilation experiments are also conducted. These include both 4D-Var and 3D-Var (with first guess at appropriate time) experiments using either (i) prescribed background-error covariances similar to those used operationally, which are static in time and include horizontally homogeneous and isotropic correlations; or (ii) flow-dependent covariances computed from the EnKF background ensembles with spatial covariance localization applied. The fifth variational data assimilation experiment is a new approach called the Ensemble-4D-Var (En-4D-Var). This approach uses 4D flow-dependent background-error covariances estimated from EnKF ensembles to produce a 4D analysis without the need for tangent-linear or adjoint versions of the forecast model. In this first part of a two-part paper, results from a series of idealized assimilation experiments are presented. In these experiments, only a single observation or vertical profile of observations is assimilated to explore the impact of various fundamental differences among the EnKF and the various variational data assimilation approaches considered. In particular, differences in the application of covariance localization in the EnKF and variational approaches are shown to have a significant impact on the assimilation of satellite radiance observations. The results also demonstrate that 4D-Var and the EnKF can both produce similar 4D background-error covariances within a 6-h assimilation window. In the second part, results from medium-range deterministic forecasts for the study period of February 2007 are presented for the EnKF and the five variational data assimilation approaches considered.},

Five different variational data assimilation approaches are considered including four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var) and three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3D-Var) with first guess at the appropriate time (3D-FGAT). Also included among these is a new approach, called Ensemble-4D-Var (En-4D-Var), that uses 4D ensemble background-error covariances from the EnKF. A description of the experimental configurations and results from single-observation experiments are presented in the first part of this two-part paper. The present paper focuses on results from medium-range deterministic forecasts initialized with analyses from the EnKF and the five variational data assimilation approaches for the period of February 2007. All experiments assimilate exactly the same full set of meteorological observations and use the same configuration of the forecast model to produce global deterministic medium-range forecasts. The quality of forecasts in the short (medium) range obtained by using the EnKF ensemble mean analysis is slightly degraded (improved) in the extratropics relative to using the 4D-Var analysis with background-error covariances similar to those used operationally. The use of the EnKF flow-dependent error covariances in the variational system (4D-Var or 3D-FGAT) leads to large (modest) forecast improvements in the southern extratropics (tropics) as compared with using covariances similar to the operational system (a gain of up to 9 h at day 5). The En-4D-Var approach leads to (i) either improved or similar forecast quality when compared with the 4D-Var experiment similar to the currently operational system, (ii) slightly worse forecast quality when compared with the 4D-Var experiment with EnKF error covariances, and (iii) generally similar forecast quality when compared with the EnKF experiment.},

  Abstract                 = {A major set of changes was made to the Environment Canada global deterministic prediction system during the fall of 2014, including the replacement of 4DVar by 4DEnVar. The new system provides improved forecast accuracy relative to the previous system, based on results from two sets of two-month data assimilation and forecast experiments. The improvements are largest at shorter lead times, but significant improvements are maintained in the 120 h forecasts for most regions and vertical levels. The improvements result from the combined impact of numerous changes, in addition to the use of 4DEnVar. These include an improved treatment of radiosonde and aircraft observations, an improved radiance bias correction procedure, the assimilation of ground-based GPS data, a doubling of the number of assimilated channels from hyperspectral infrared sounders, and an improved approach for initializing model forecasts. Due to the replacement of 4DVar with 4DEnVar, the new system is also more computationally efficient and easier to parallelize, facilitating a doubling of the analysis increment horizontal resolution. Replacement of a full-field digital filter with the 4D incremental analysis update approach, and the recycling of several key variables that are not directly analyzed significantly reduced the model spin-up both during the data assimilation cycle and in medium-range forecasts.},

  Abstract                 = {A new approach is presented and evaluated for efficiently applying scale-dependent spatial localisation to ensemble background-error covariances within an ensemble-variational data assimilation system. The approach is primarily motivated by the requirements of future data assimilation systems for global numerical weather prediction that will be capable of resolving the convective scale. Such systems must estimate the global and synoptic scales at least as well as current global systems while also effectively making use of information from frequent and spatially dense observation networks to constrain convective-scale features. Scale-dependent covariance localisation allows a wider range of scales to be efficiently estimated while simultaneously assimilating all available observations. In the context of an idealised numerical experiment, it is shown that using scale-dependent localisation produces an improved ensemble-based estimate of spatially varying covariances as compared with standard spatial localisation. When applied to an ensemble of Arctic sea-ice concentration, it is demonstrated that strong spatial gradients in the relative contribution of different spatial scales in the ensemble covariances result in strong spatial variations in the overall amount of spatial localisation. This feature is qualitatively similar to what might be expected when applying an adaptive localisation approach that estimates a spatially varying localisation function from the ensemble itself. When compared with standard spatial localisation, scale-dependent localisation also results in a lower analysis error for sea-ice concentration over all spatial scales.Keywords: EnVar, EnKF, ensemble data assimilation, covariance localisation, sea-ice concentration(Published: 4 December 2015)Citation: Tellus A 2015, 67, 28027, http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/tellusa.v67.28027},

  Abstract                 = {This paper discusses an important issue related to the implementation and interpretation of the analysis scheme in the ensemble Kalman filter. It is shown that the observations must be treated as random variables at the analysis steps. That is, one should add random perturbations with the correct statistics to the observations and generate an ensemble of observations that then is used in updating the ensemble of model states. Traditionally, this has not been done in previous applications of the ensemble Kalman filter and, as will be shown, this has resulted in an updated ensemble with a variance that is too low.This simple modification of the analysis scheme results in a completely consistent approach if the covariance of the ensemble of model states is interpreted as the prediction error covariance, and there are no further requirements on the ensemble Kalman filter method, except for the use of an ensemble of sufficient size. Thus, there is a unique correspondence between the error statistics from the ensemble Kalman filter and the standard Kalman filter approach.},

The full method is applied with real data to a flash-flood event, which occurred in a mountainous area. For this complex case, the assimilation of reflectivity data improves short-term precipitation forecasts. The assimilation of reflectivity data has a positive impact on the convective system's dynamics by feeding the cold pool under the storm, which controls the intensity and location of the updrafts. A one-hourly update cycle of 3 h further improves these results.A sensitivity study is also presented to evaluate the assimilation method for this flash-flood event in different conditions. The smoothing coefficient involved in the 1-D retrieval is shown to have a very small impact on analyses and quantitative precipitation forecasts. The assimilation of reflectivity data is found to be able to cause the creation of a cold pool, which modifies favourably the precipitation quantitative forecast. Finally, results from an 8-d-long assimilation cycle are presented.},

The implementation of this algorithm implies the computation of the trace of certain matrices which are not explicitly known. A method proposed by Girard, allowing an approximate estimation of the traces without explicit knowledge of the matrices, was then used. This paper proposes a new implementation of the Desroziers and Ivanov algorithm, including a new computation scheme for the required traces. This method is compared to Girard's in two aspects: its use in the implementation of the tuning algorithm, and the computation of a quantification of the observation impacts on the analysis known as Degrees of Freedom for Signal. Those results are illustrated by studies utilizing the French data assimilation/numerical weather-prediction system ARPEGE. The impact of a first quasi-operational tuning of variances on forecasts is shown and discussed. Copyright © 2006 Royal Meteorological Society},

The scheme uses the extended control variable technique to implement a hybrid background error covariance that combines the standard climatological covariance with a covariance derived from the 23-member operational ensemble MOGREPS-G. Unique features of the Met Office scheme include application of a horizontal âanti-aliasingâ filter to the ensemble error modes, a vertical localization scheme based uniquely on a modification of the climatological stream function covariance, and inflation of the climatological covariance to maintain the analysis fit to observations. Findings during development include a significantly greater impact of the scheme in 3D-Var than 4D-Var, a clear positive impact from the combination of the anti-aliasing filter and vertical localization, and a relatively small sensitivity to full coupling of the ensemble and 4D-Var systems. Supplementary experiments suggest that the ability of the ensemble to capture coherent âErrors of the Dayâ is key to the improvements in forecast skill.A particular problem encountered during development was significantly poorer tropical verification scores when measured against own analyses. In contrast, verification against independent (ECMWF) analyses gave scores that were much more consistent with those against observations. Copyright © 2012 British Crown Copyright, the Met Office.

Assuming the model is perfect, both 4D-Var and 4D-PSAS are equivalent in terms of results produced and cost. Assuming the model is not perfect, the equivalence is preserved, but in 4D-Var it is necessary to increase the size of the control variable while 4D-PSAS remains almost unchanged. In duality, 4D-Var remains almost unchanged by an increase in the number of observations used, whereas the size of the control variable in PSAS depends directly on this number.},

The 3D-Var formulation uses a spherical-harmonic expansion, much as the ECMWF optimal interpolation (OI) scheme used an expansion of Bessel functions. This formulation is introduced using a convolution algebra over the sphere expressed directly in spectral space. It is shown that all features of the OI statistical model can be implemented within 3D-Var. Furthermore, a non-separable statistical model is described. In the present formulation, geostrophy is accounted for through a Hough-modes separation of the gravity and Rossby components of the analysis increments. As in OI, the tropical analysis remains essentially non-divergent and with a weak mass-wind coupling. The observations used, as well as their specified statistics of errors, are presented, together with some implementation details. In the light of the results, 3D-Var was implemented operationally at the end of January 1996.},

We prove that the only non-trivial conformal mapping which exists between the two spheres is based on the transformation introduced by Schmidt, but the pole of the collocation grid has no longer to coincide with the pole of dilatation. We implement the technique in an explicit model, where only minor modifications to a uniform resolution model are needed. The semi-implicit scheme and the nonlinear normal mode initialization are proved to work satisfactorily. 24-hour forecasts show that the method is successful in dealing with the shallow-water equations and allow us to discuss the potential of the approach.},

  Abstract                 = {A simple stochastic model, based on a Poisson birth-death process, is proposed as a test bed for convective-scale data assimilation methods. The simple model mimics the extreme nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity associated with rapidly developing and intermittent convective storms. In this framework, we evaluate the Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (ETKF) and Sequential Importance Resampling (SIR) filter, and assess the impact of two strategies to improve their performance and efficiency: localization and observation averaging. In their basic implementations, both filters perform poorly. The SIR filter rapidly collapses, then very gradually converges to the observations as random perturbations introduced by resampling occasionally improve the analysis. The ETKF rapidly assimilates the correct locations of convective storms, but has large errors due to creation of spurious clouds by nonlinear amplification of small data assimilation increments. Localization, i.e. assimilating only local observations to produce the analysis at a given grid point, dramatically improves the performance of the SIR filter, but does not reduce errors in the ETKF. Observation averaging, i.e. spatially smoothing the observations before assimilation and thus making the distribution more Gaussian, is also effective for the SIR filter, and improves convergence of the ETKF.

The method involves the relaxation of the interior flow in the vicinity of the boundary to the external fully prescribed flow. A systematic study of the method is undertaken with an (x, z), linear, primitive equation model. Analytical considerations of the method for the continuous equations demonstrate the manner in which the method consumes gravity wave energy, error and fine spatial scale potential vorticity near the lateral boundaries. Numerical experiments are also undertaken to assess the usefulness of the method. The results indicate that the method gives an adequate representation of outgoing gravity waves with and without an ambient shear flow, and also allows the substantially undistorted transmission of geostrophically balanced flow out of the interior of the limited domain.On the basis of these results, it is suggested that the method constitutes a promising utilitarian treatment of the lateral boundaries.},

The data assimilation system uses a high resolution global ocean model to extrapolate the information forward in time. The data inserted into the model currently consists only of conventional sea surface temperature observations and vertical temperature profiles. The data are inserted continuously into the model by updating the model's temperature solution every timestep. This update is created using a statistical interpolation routine applied to all data in a 30-day window centered on the present timestep. Large scale features in the sea surface temperature analyses are consistent with those from independent analyses. Subsurface fields created from the assimilation are much more realistic than those produced without the insertion of data. Furthermore, information contained in the assimilation field is shown to be retained in the model solution after the assimilation procedure is terminated. The results are encouraging but further improvements can be made.},

  Abstract                 = {The specification of a correct background-error covariance matrix is a key issue in data assimilation schemes. The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) aims at providing simulations of analysis and background errors and then gives a way to determine this background-error covariance matrix. The EnKF can be transposed to variational ensemble assimilation, where a set of perturbed variational analyses are performed. In this case, however, there is an evident important additional cost associated with the use of multiple minimizations. The aim of the paper is to investigate different techniques to reduce the cost of the multiple minimizations that have to be performed.In particular, the use is investigated of a preconditioning technique based on Ritz eigenpairs resulting from a first minimization performed by a combined Lanczos/conjugate-gradient algorithm. The possibility is also studied of improving the starting point of a new perturbed solution, with Lanczos vectors issued from a single prior unperturbed or perturbed minimization. This appears to provide a first significant reduction in the cost of the new minimization.Finally, a new approach is proposed to generalize the previous idea to the use of multiple sets of Lanczos vectors issued from an ensemble of perturbed assimilations. The application of this procedure to a simplified analysis problem shows encouraging results, as it appears to be a possible way for reducing the global cost of an ensemble variational assimilation. Moreover, this seems to provide an efficient strategy for parallelizing such an ensemble variational assimilation but also the deterministic variational assimilation itself.

  Abstract                 = {10.1002/qj.200513161313.abs Most operational assimilation schemes rely on linear estimation theory. Under this assumption, it is shown how simple consistency diagnostics can be obtained for the covariances of observation, background and estimation errors in observation space. Those diagnostics are shown to be nearly cost-free since they only combine quantities available after the analysis, i.e. observed values and their background and analysis counterparts in observation space. A first application of such diagnostics is presented on analyses provided by the French 4D-Var assimilation. A procedure to refine background and observation-error variances is also proposed and tested in a simple toy analysis problem. The possibility to diagnose cross-correlations between observation errors is also investigated in this same simple framework. A spectral interpretation of the diagnosed covariances is finally presented, which allows us to highlight the role of the scale separation between background and observation errors.

These computations allow the tuning of observation-error weighting parameters by applying a simple iterative fixed-point procedure. The procedure is first tested in a simplified variational scheme on a circular domain and then in a similar scheme but with the addition of the vertical coordinate. The relationship between the proposed approach and the Generalized Cross Validation is also shown. A test in the French Action de Recherche Petite Echelle Grande Echelle (ARPEGE) three-dimensional variational framework with both simulated observations and background fields is finally performed. It shows that a complete description of observation-error parameters can be retrieved with only a few iterations and, thus, at a reasonable cost.},

Practical implementations of the 4DEnVar are also investigated and two new preconditioned algorithms are proposed. The hybrid formulation of 4DEnVar, combining static and ensemble background-error covariances, is discussed for the different possible algorithms.

  Abstract                 = {With ideal spatial adaptation, an oracle furnishes information about how best to adapt a spatially variable estimator, whether piecewise constant, piecewise polynomial, variable knot spline, or variable bandwidth kernel, to the unknown function. Estimation with the aid of an oracle offers dramatic advantages over traditional linear estimation by nonadaptive kernels; however, it is a priori unclear whether such performance can be obtained by a procedure relying on the data alone. We describe a new principle for spatially-adaptive estimation: selective wavelet reconstruction. We show that variable-knot spline fits and piecewise-polynomial fits, when equipped with an oracle to select the knots, are not dramatically more powerful than selective wavelet reconstruction with an oracle. We develop a practical spatially adaptive method, Risk Shrink, which works by shrinkage of empirical wavelet coefficients. RiskShrink mimics the performance of an oracle for selective wavelet reconstruction as well as it is possible to do so. A new inequality in multivariate normal decision theory which we call the oracle inequality shows that attained performance differs from ideal performance by at most a factor of approximately 2 log n, where n is the sample size. Moreover no estimator can give a better guarantee than this. Within the class of spatially adaptive procedures, RiskShrink is essentially optimal. Relying only on the data, it comes within a factor log2n of the performance of piecewise polynomial and variableknot spline methods equipped with an oracle. In contrast, it is unknown how or if piecewise polynomial methods could be made to function this well when denied access to an oracle and forced to rely on data alone.},

  Abstract                 = {Presently, a preferred minimization for strong-constraint four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) assimilation uses a Lanczos-based conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm. This requires the availability of a square-root of the background-error covariance matrix (B). In the context of weak-constraint 4D-Var, this requirement might be too restrictive for the formulations of the model error term. It might therefore be desirable to avoid a square-root decomposition of the augmented background term. An appealing minimization scheme is the double CG minimization employed, for example, in the grid-point statistical interpolation (GSI) analysis. Realizing the double CG algorithm is a special case of the more general bi-conjugate gradient (BiCG) method for solving non-symmetric problems, the present work introduces a Lanczos-based preconditioning strategy when B, instead of its square-root, is used initially. Implementation of the scheme is done in the context of the GSI analysis system, and preliminary experiments are presented using its 3D-Var version. Comparison of the Lanczos-based CG and the BiCG shows that the algorithms converge at the same rate and to the same solution. Despite the additional computational cost, the importance of the re-orthogonalization step is also shown to be fundamental to any of these CG algorithms. Furthermore, when using the Hessian eigenvectors for preconditioning, the BiCG behaviour is shown to be comparable to that of the Lanczos-CG algorithm. Both schemes construct the same approximation of the Hessian with the same number of eigenvectors, and benefit in the same way from the reduction of the condition number. The efficiency, computational cost, and stability of the three algorithms are discussed. Copyright © 2012 Royal Meteorological Society},

  Abstract                 = {The implementation of a regional ensemble data assimilation and forecasting system requires the specification of appropriate perturbations of lateral boundary conditions (LBCs), in order to simulate associated errors. The sensitivity of analysis and 6-h forecast ensemble spread to these perturbations is studied here formally and experimentally by comparing three different LBC configurations for the ensemble data assimilation system of the ALADIN-France limited-area model (LAM). While perturbed initial LBCs are provided by the perturbed LAM analyses in each ensemble, the three ensemble configurations differ with respect to LBCs used at 3- and 6-h forecast ranges, which respectively correspond to: (1) perturbed LBCs provided by the operational global ensemble data assimilation system (GLBC), which is considered as a reference configuration; (2) unperturbed LBCs (ULBC) obtained from the global deterministic model; (3) perturbed LBCs obtained by adding random draws of an error covariance model (PLBC) to the global deterministic system. A formal analysis of error and perturbation equations is first carried out, in order to provide an insight of the relative effects of observation perturbations and of LBC perturbations at different ranges, in the various ensemble configurations. Horizontal variations of time-averaged ensemble spread are then examined for 6-h forecasts. Despite the use of perturbed initial LBCs, the regional ensemble ULBC is underdispersive not only near the lateral boundaries, but also in approximately one-third of the inner area, due to advection during the data assimilation cycle. This artefact is avoided in PLBC through the additional use of non-zero LBC perturbations at 3- and 6-h ranges, and the sensitivity to the amplitude scaling of the covariance model is illustrated for this configuration. Some aspects of the temporal variation of ensemble spread and associated sensitivities to LBC perturbations are also studied. These results confirm the importance of LBC perturbations for regional ensemble data assimilation. They also indicate that perturbing initial LBC is not sufficient to obtain realistic ensemble spread, whereas this can be achieved approximately by using random covariance draws for simulating LBC errors during the forecast and associated data assimilation cycling.Keywords: lateral boundary conditions, regional ensemble, data assimilation, ensemble spread(Published: 15 December 2015)},

  Abstract                 = {A new sequential data assimilation method is discussed. It is based on forecasting the error statistics using Monte Carlo methods, a better alternative than solving the traditional and computationally extremely demanding approximate error covariance equation used in the extended Kalman filter. The unbounded error growth found in the extended Kalman filter, which is caused by an overly simplified closure in the error covariance equation, is completely eliminated. Open boundaries can be handled as long as the ocean model is well posed. Well-known numerical instabilities associated with the error covariance equation are avoided because storage and evolution of the error covariance matrix itself are not needed. The results are also better than what is provided by the extended Kalman filter since there is no closure problem and the quality of the forecast error statistics therefore improves. The method should be feasible also for more sophisticated primitive equation models. The computational load for reasonable accuracy is only a fraction of what is required for the extended Kalman filter and is given by the storage of, say, 100 model states for an ensemble size of 100 and thus CPU requirements of the order of the cost of 100 model integrations. The proposed method can therefore be used with realistic nonlinear ocean models on large domains on existing computers, and it is also well suited for parallel computers and clusters of workstations where each processor integrates a few members of the ensemble.},

Such a flow generates inertio-gravity waves which interact with the rotational eddies. We found that both inertio-gravity waves and rotation reduce the non-linear interactions between vortices, namely the condensation of the vorticity field into isolated coherent vortices, corresponding to the inverse rotational energy cascade, and the associated production of vorticity filaments, due to the direct potential enstrophy cascade. Rotation also inhibits the direct inertio-gravitational energy cascade for scales larger than the Rossby deformation radius. Therefore, if inertio-gravity waves are initially excited at large enough scales, they will remain trapped there due to rotation and there will be no geostrophic adjustment. On the contrary, if inertio-gravity waves are only present at scales smaller than the Rossby deformation radius, which are insensitive to the effect of rotation, they will non-linearly interact and cascade towards the dissipative scales, leaving the flow in geostrophic equilibrium.},

The purpose of this system is to provide improved precipitation forecasts at mesoscale and in the short range, up to 18 hours. The goal of the paper is threefold. Firstly, we present initial considerations for the design of the 3D-Var system. Secondly, we discuss in more detail the specification of the background-error covariance matrix, by comparing three different error simulation techniques, namely two variants of the NMC method and an ensemble-based approach. The formal, diagnostic and impact studies have led to the selection of the ensemblebased covariances for the ALADIN/France assimilation. Thirdly, scores of quantitative precipitation forecasts are shown in order to illustrate the robustness and the preliminary meteorological performance of the ALADIN/France assimilation suite. The results indicate that the tested configuration improves some aspects of the precipitation forecast, while being neutral for others, when compared with the spin-up model.We conclude the paper by providing a more explicit insight into the future evolution of limited-area variational analysis towards convective-scale data assimilation.

At the end of the interval, the Kalman smoother estimate is identical to that produced by a Kalman filter, given the same observations and the same initial state and covariance matrix. For an imperfect model, the model error term in the covariance evolution equation acts to reduce the dependence of the estimate on observations and prior states that are well separated in time. In particular, if the assimilation interval is sufficiently long, the estimate at the end of the interval is effectively independent of the state and covariance matrix specified at the beginning of the interval. In this case, the Kalman smoother provides estimates at the end of the interval that are identical to those of a Kalman filter that has been running indefinitely. For a linear model, weak-constraint four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var) is equivalent to a fixed-interval Kalman smoother. It follows that, if the assimilation interval is made sufficiently long, the 4D-Var analysis at the end of the assimilation interval will be identical to that produced by a Kalman filter that has been running indefinitely. The equivalence between weak-constraint 4D-Var and a long-running Kalman filter is demonstrated for a simple analogue of the numerical weather-prediction (NWP) problem. For this nonlinear system, 4D-Var analysis with a 10-day assimilation window produces analyses of the same quality as those of an extended Kalman filter. It is demonstrated that the current ECMWF operational 4D-Var system retains a memory of earlier observations and prior states over a period of between four and ten days, suggesting that weak-constraint 4D-Var with an analysis interval in the range of four to ten days may provide a viable algorithm with which to implement an unapproximated Kalman filter. Whereas assimilation intervals of this length are unlikely to be computationally feasible for operational NWP in the near future, the ability to run an unapproximated Kalman filter should prove invaluable for assessing the performance of cheaper, but suboptimal, alternatives.

  Abstract                 = {All practical ensemble-based atmospheric data assimilation (DA) systems use localisation to reduce the damaging impact of spurious long-range correlations arising from the finite ensemble size. However, the form of the localisation function is generally ad-hoc, and requires expensive tuning to optimise the system. For the case of a single observation and known true background error correlation, we derive an expression for the localisation factor that minimises the expected root-mean-square (RMS) analysis error. Idealised tests show this formulation performs well for multiple observations provided their density is not too high. The width of the optimal localisation function scales with the width of the underlying correlation, but does not have the same shape. The optimal observation-space localisation for a single spatially integrating observation depends on the observation-to-gridpoint background error correlation, making it broader than the optimal localisation for point observations and potentially competitive with model-space localisation. A new form of hybrid DA is proposed in which localisation damps the sample correlations towards their climatological mean rather than zero, reducing the RMS error and potentially improving the dynamic balance of the analysis. The presence of variance errors causes the optimal localisation factor to depend on the ratio of observation to background error variance, and raises the possibility that a small amount of variance damping may be beneficial. For dense observations, a more elaborate theory is required, which will almost certainly depend on the observation network. We present some preliminary analysis of the features of the multi-observation problem, which for instance suggests that the optimal solution may involve different localisation factors in the numerator and denominator of the Kalman filter equation. We note that even optimal localisation gives an expected RMS error which exceeds that of perfect DA, contrary to the assumption made by ‘deterministic’ ensemble filters.Keywords: ensemble data assimilation, sampling error, sample correlation, Schur product, integrating observations, hybrid data assimilation(Published: 13 February 2015)Citation: Tellus A 2015, 67, 25257, http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/tellusa.v67.25257},

  Abstract                 = {This work studies the effects of sampling variability in Monte Carlo-based methods to estimate very high-dimensional systems. Recent focus in the geosciences has been on representing the atmospheric state using a probability density function, and, for extremely high-dimensional systems, various sample-based Kalman filter techniques have been developed to address the problem of real-time assimilation of system information and observations. As the employed sample sizes are typically several orders of magnitude smaller than the system dimension, such sampling techniques inevitably induce considerable variability into the state estimate, primarily through prior and posterior sample covariance matrices. In this article, we quantify this variability with mean squared error measures for two Monte Carlo-based Kalman filter variants: the ensemble Kalman filter and the ensemble square-root Kalman filter. Expressions of the error measures are derived under weak assumptions and show that sample sizes need to grow proportionally to the square of the system dimension for bounded error growth. To reduce necessary ensemble size requirements and to address rank-deficient sample covariances, covariance-shrinking (tapering) based on the Schur product of the prior sample covariance and a positive definite function is demonstrated to be a simple, computationally feasible, and very effective technique. Rules for obtaining optimal taper functions for both stationary as well as non-stationary covariances are given, and optimal taper lengths are given in terms of the ensemble size and practical range of the forecast covariance. Results are also presented for optimal covariance inflation. The theory is verified and illustrated with extensive simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {Variational data assimilation problems in meteorology and oceanography require the solution of a regularized nonlinear least-squares problem. Practical solution algorithms are based on the incremental (truncated Gauss–Newton) approach, which involves the iterative solution of a sequence of linear least-squares (quadratic minimization) sub-problems. Each sub-problem can be solved using a primal approach, where the minimization is performed in a space spanned by vectors of the size of the model control vector, or a dual approach, where the minimization is performed in a space spanned by vectors of the size of the observation vector. The dual formulation can be advantageous for two reasons. First, the dimension of the minimization problem with the dual formulation does not increase when additional control variables are considered, such as those accounting for model error in a weak-constraint formulation. Second, whenever the dimension of observation space is significantly smaller than that of the model control space, the dual formulation can reduce both memory usage and computational cost.In this article, a new dual-based algorithm called Restricted B-preconditioned Lanczos (RBLanczos) is introduced, where B denotes the background-error covariance matrix. RBLanczos is the Lanczos formulation of the Restricted B-preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (RBCG) method. RBLanczos generates mathematically equivalent iterates to those of RBCG and the corresponding B-preconditioned Conjugate Gradient and Lanczos algorithms used in the primal approach. All these algorithms can be implemented without the need for a square-root factorization of B. RBCG and RBLanczos, as well as the corresponding primal algorithms, are implemented in two operational ocean data assimilation systems and numerical results are presented. Practical diagnostic formulae for monitoring the convergence properties of the minimization are also presented.},

  Abstract                 = {This article focuses on the construction, directly in physical space, of simply parametrized covariance functions for data-assimilation applications. A self-contained, rigorous mathematical summary of relevant topics from correlation theory is provided as a foundation for this construction. Covariance and correlation functions are defined, and common notions of homogeneity and isotropy are clarified. Classical results are stated, and proven where instructive. Included are smoothness properties relevant to multivariate statistical-analysis algorithms where wind/wind and wind/mass correlation models are obtained by differentiating the correlation model of a mass variable. the Convolution Theorem is introduced as the primary tool used to construct classes of covariance and cross-covariance functions on three-dimensional Euclidean space R3. Among these are classes of compactly supported functions that restrict to covariance and cross-covariance functions on the unit sphere S2, and that vanish identically on subsets of positive measure on S2. It is shown that these covariance and cross-covariance functions on S2, referred to as being space-limited, cannot be obtained using truncated spectral expansions. Compactly supported and space-limited covariance functions determine sparse covariance matrices when evaluated on a grid, thereby easing computational burdens in atmospheric data-analysis algorithms.Convolution integrals leading to practical examples of compactly supported covariance and cross-covariance functions on R3 are reduced and evaluated. More specifically, suppose that gi and gj are radially symmetric functions defined on R3 such that gi(x) = 0 for |x| &gt; di and gj(x) = 0 for |xv &gt; dj, O &lt; di,dj &lE;, where |. | denotes Euclidean distance in R3. the parameters di and dj are lsquocut-offrsquo distances. Closed-form expressions are determined for classes of convolution cross-covariance functions Cij(x,y) := (gi * gj)(x-y), i ne j, and convolution covariance functions Cii(x,y) := (gi * gi)(x-y), vanishing for |x - y| &gt; di + dj and |x - y| &gt; 2di, respectively, Additional covariance functions on R3 are constructed using convolutions over the real numbers R, rather than R3. Families of compactly supported approximants to standard second- and third-order autoregressive functions are constructed as illustrative examples. Compactly supported covariance functions of the form C(x,y) := Co(|x - y|), x,y isin R3, where the functions Co(r) for r isin R are 5th-order piecewise rational functions, are also constructed. These functions are used to develop space-limited product covariance functions B(x, y) C(x, y), x, y isin S2, approximating given covariance functions B(x, y) supported on all of S2 × S2.},

This result is then extended to cover the comparison of the singular evolutive extended Kalman (SEEK) filter with a reduced variant of the 4D-Var algorithm. We next concentrate on the solution of the 4D-Var, which is usually computed with a (truncated) Gauss-Newton algorithm using a preconditioned conjugate-gradient-like (CG) method. Motivated by the equivalence of the above-mentioned algorithms, we explore techniques used in the SEEK filter and based on empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) as an attempt to accelerate the Gauss-Newton method further. This leads to the development of an appropriate starting point for the CG method, together with that of a powerful limited-memory preconditioner (LMP), as shown by preliminary numerical experiments performed on a shallow-water model.

  Abstract                 = {We address the problem of how to take advantage, in a limited-area variational assimilation, of the previously-performed global data analysis of the coupling system. We expect this information to add value to the limited-area analysis, since, for example, the global analysis can deal with observations close to but outside the domain of interest. The global analysis is treated as an extra source of information, and we derive the full least-square error problem for the augmented information vector. We are left with the specifications of a global analysis-error covariance matrix and extra cross-covariance terms, expressed in a lower-resolution grid covering all of the coupled domain. Simplifications are proposed to make the problem algorithmically more tractable, especially in order to benefit from the advances in the "modelization" of the background-error covariance matrix. Further, we obtain a more classical minimization problem for the sum of three, instead of two, additive cost functions.We have tested the formulation in the framework of the coupled ARPEGE 4D-Var and ALADIN-France 3D-Var systems. Objective scores with respect to radiosonde and aircraft observations give neutral or slightly positive results for the proposed method. The information-augmented assimilation cycle produces background 6 h forecasts that are slightly closer to the verifying observations. Subjective case-by-case verification does not reveal a visible systematic beneficial impact on the quality of the forecasts, especially for small-scale parameters such as precipitation. We nevertheless propose to apply the method in future to very high-resolution assimilation systems, which are likely to be operated on fairly small domains.

  Abstract                 = {Since July 2008, Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Interferometer (IASI) radiances have been assimilated in the French global model Action de Recherche Petite Echelle Grande Echelle (ARPEGE) and since April 2010 at high density in the French convective-scale model Applications of Research to Operations at MEsoscale (AROME).The impact of the assimilation of clear IASI data on forecast skill is found to be positive for both models. As many observed scenes are cloudy, several ways to characterize the clouds within the observed spectra are investigated. Firstly, a simple approach that enables the determination of both the cloud-top pressure and the effective cloud amount of an equivalent single-layer cloud is followed using a CO2-slicing method. The first assimilation trials in overcast conditions lead to a small positive impact on forecast skill. Another approach would be to take advantage of the fact that cloud water variables are described at high resolution in the convective-scale model AROME. Model cloud fields have to be used in conjunction with a cloudy radiative transfer model. The first simulations using this technique are performed and compared against observations.

This cloud type is combined with precipitation information from radar data and with hourly diagnostic analyses of 2-metre relative humidity and 10-metre wind to elaborate an hourly analysis of fog probability. This analysis provides four levels of fog probability with a 3-kilometre horizontal resolution: No risk, low-level risk, medium-level risk and high-level risk. An evaluation of such fog probability analyses versus a one-year set of French hourly SYNOP reports shows encouraging results (potential of detection = 0.73 for low and medium and high-level risks), even if false alarm ratios remain high. Most of the non-detections occur at twilight and are due to satellite non-detections. Eventually, we show case studies that clearly illustrate the high potential of the method.},

  Abstract                 = {A hybrid ensemble Kalman filter&#8211;three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) analysis scheme is demonstrated using a quasigeostrophic model under perfect-model assumptions. Four networks with differing observational densities are tested, including one network with a data void. The hybrid scheme operates by computing a set of parallel data assimilation cycles, with each member of the set receiving unique perturbed observations. The perturbed observations are generated by adding random noise consistent with observation error statistics to the control set of observations. Background error statistics for the data assimilation are estimated from a linear combination of time-invariant 3DVAR covariances and flow-dependent covariances developed from the ensemble of short-range forecasts. The hybrid scheme allows the user to weight the relative contributions of the 3DVAR and ensemble-based background covariances.The analysis scheme was cycled for 90 days, with new observations assimilated every 12 h. Generally, it was found that the analysis performs best when background error covariances are estimated almost fully from the ensemble, especially when the ensemble size was large. When small-sized ensembles are used, some lessened weighting of ensemble-based covariances is desirable. The relative improvement over 3DVAR analyses was dependent upon the observational data density and norm; generally, there is less improvement for data-rich networks than for data-poor networks, with the largest improvement for the network with the data void. As expected, errors depend on the size of the ensemble, with errors decreasing as more ensemble members are added. The sets of initial conditions generated from the hybrid are generally well calibrated and provide an improved set of initial conditions for ensemble forecasts.},

  Abstract                 = {The usefulness of a distance-dependent reduction of background error covariance estimates in an ensemble Kalman filter is demonstrated. Covariances are reduced by performing an elementwise multiplication of the background error covariance matrix with a correlation function with local support. This reduces noisiness and results in an improved background error covariance estimate, which generates a reduced-error ensemble of model initial conditions.The benefits of applying the correlation function can be understood in part from examining the characteristics of simple 2 &#215; 2 covariance matrices generated from random sample vectors with known variances and covariance. These show that noisiness in covariance estimates tends to overwhelm the signal when the ensemble size is small and&#47;or the true covariance between the sample elements is small. Since the true covariance of forecast errors is generally related to the distance between grid points, covariance estimates generally have a higher ratio of noise to signal with increasing distance between grid points. This property is also demonstrated using a two-layer hemispheric primitive equation model and comparing covariance estimates generated by small and large ensembles. Covariances from the large ensemble are assumed to be accurate and are used a reference for measuring errors from covariances estimated from a small ensemble.The benefits of including distance-dependent reduction of covariance estimates are demonstrated with an ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation scheme. The optimal correlation length scale of the filter function depends on ensemble size; larger correlation lengths are preferable for larger ensembles.The effects of inflating background error covariance estimates are examined as a way of stabilizing the filter. It was found that more inflation was necessary for smaller ensembles than for larger ensembles.},

  Abstract                 = {The various implementations of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) differ from each other in several ways. The effects of these differences are not yet well and completely explored and they include the use of sequential or simultaneous assimilation of observations and the application of localization to the observation error covariance matrix (R-localization) or the background error covariance matrix (B-localization). This study seeks to examine and better understand the effects of these differences, both individually and in combination. To that end, a B-localized sequential scheme, a B-localized simultaneous scheme, an R-localized sequential scheme and an R-localized simultaneous scheme are compared using a primitive equation two-layer model with simulated observations and an imperfect model assumption. The comparisons in initial assimilation experiments show that the use of sequential or simultaneous assimilation and R-/B-localization impacts the accuracy of the EnKF analyses and forecasts. Diagnostic experiments show that the schemes generate different amounts of imbalance in the analysis as a result of systematic differences among the schemes in height gradient and wind increments. These disparities in analysis balance translate into accuracy differences during the subsequent forecast and analysis steps. Additional simplified experiments suggest that the differences caused by the sequential or simultaneous assimilation and the R-/B-localization are a function of the characteristic shape of the background error covariances in the model system. Several elements of the forecast-assimilation system including the use of digital filter initialization, the number and type of observations, the ensemble size and the ratio of forecast error to observation error are identified that can significantly increase or decrease the magnitude of the observed differences caused by sequential or simultaneous assimilation and the R-/B-localization.

The kinematics of two-dimensional homogeneous turbulence is used to partition the perceived forecast errors into prediction errors which are horizontally correlated, and observational errors which are assumed to be horizontally uncorrelated. The theory further partitions the wind prediction errors into three components, viz. large-scale, rotational and divergent components, and provides a spectral description of the covariance and cross-covariance functions for stream function and velocity potential. The calculations also provide an estimate of the vertical error covariance matrices for prediction error and for radiosonde observational error, by which we mean the combined effects of instrumental error and errors of representativeness. The basic assumptions are that the forecast errors are horizontally homogeneous and that the observational errors are horizontally uncorrelated. Several important results are found. The wind prediction errors are comparable in magnitude with the wind observation errors. The prediction errors are dominated by the synoptic scales, but there is a substantial large scale wind error which reverses phase between the stratosphere and troposphere. The synoptic scale errors are largely non-divergent in the troposphere. There are good grounds for increasing the resolution of the analysis system, both in the horizontal and the vertical, over North America and other data-rich regions.},

  Abstract                 = {In the past, studies of stratosphere-troposphere exchange of mass and chemical species have mainly emphasized the synoptic- and small-scale mechanisms of exchange. This review, however, includes also the global-scale aspects of exchange, such as the transport across an isentropic surface (potential temperature about 380 K) that in the tropics lies just above the tropopause, near the 100-hPa pressure level. Such a surface divides the stratosphere into an “overworld” and an extratropical “lowermost stratosphere” that for transport purposes need to be sharply distinguished. This approach places stratosphere-troposphere exchange in the framework of the general circulation and helps to clarify the roles of the different mechanisms involved and the interplay between large and small scales. The role of waves and eddies in the extratropical overworld is emphasized. There, wave-induced forces drive a kind of global-scale extratropical “fluid-dynamical suction pump,” which withdraws air upward and poleward from the tropical lower stratosphere and pushes it poleward and downward into the extratropical troposphere. The resulting global-scale circulation drives the stratosphere away from radiative equilibrium conditions. Wave-induced forces may be considered to exert a nonlocal control, mainly downward in the extratropics but reaching laterally into the tropics, over the transport of mass across lower stratospheric isentropic surfaces. This mass transport is for many purposes a useful measure of global-scale stratosphere-troposphere exchange, especially on seasonal or longer timescales. Because the strongest wave-induced forces occur in the northern hemisphere winter season, the exchange rate is also a maximum at that season. The global exchange rate is not determined by details of near-tropopause phenomena such as penetrative cumulus convection or small-scale mixing associated with upper level fronts and cyclones. These smaller-scale processes must be considered, however, in order to understand the finer details of exchange. Moist convection appears to play an important role in the tropics in accounting for the extreme dehydration of air entering the stratosphere. Stratospheric air finds its way back into the troposphere through a vast variety of irreversible eddy exchange phenomena, including tropopause folding and the formation of so-called tropical upper tropospheric troughs and consequent irreversible exchange. General circulation models are able to simulate the mean global-scale mass exchange and its seasonal cycle but are not able to properly resolve the tropical dehydration process. Two-dimensional (height-latitude) models commonly used for assessment of human impact on the ozone layer include representation of stratosphere-troposphere exchange that is adequate to allow reasonable simulation of photochemical processes occurring in the overworld. However, for assessing changes in the lowermost stratosphere, the strong longitudinal asymmetries in stratosphere-troposphere exchange render current two-dimensional models inadequate. Either current transport parameterizations must be improved, or else, more likely, such changes can be adequately assessed only by three-dimensional models.},

  Abstract                 = {An ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has been implemented at the Canadian Meteorological Centre to provide an ensemble of initial conditions for the medium-range ensemble prediction system. This demonstrates that the EnKF can be used for operational atmospheric data assimilation.We show how the EnKF relates to the Kalman filter. In particular, to make the ensemble approximation feasible, we have to use a fairly small ensemble with many less members than either the number of model coordinates, or the number of independent observations, or the (unknown) dimension of the dynamical system. To nevertheless obtain good results, we must (i) counter the tendency of the ensemble spread to underestimate the true error, and (ii) localize the ensemble covariances. The localization is severe and leads to imbalance in the initial conditions.The operational EnKF is used to investigate to what extent our system respects the underlying hypotheses of both the Kalman filter and its ensemble approximation. In particular, we quantify the imbalance in the initial conditions and the magnitude of the model-error component. The occurrence of imbalance constrains the ways in which time interpolation can be performed and in which parametrized model error can be added. With this study we hope to obtain and provide guidance for further improvements to the EnKF. Copyright © 2005 Royal Meteorological Society},

  Abstract                 = {An ensemble Kalman filter may be considered for the 4D assimilation of atmospheric data. In this paper, an efficient implementation of the analysis step of the filter is proposed. It employs a Schur (elementwise) product of the covariances of the background error calculated from the ensemble and a correlation function having local support to filter the small (and noisy) background-error covariances associated with remote observations. To solve the Kalman filter equations, the observations are organized into batches that are assimilated sequentially. For each batch, a Cholesky decomposition method is used to solve the system of linear equations. The ensemble of background fields is updated at each step of the sequential algorithm and, as more and more batches of observations are assimilated, evolves to eventually become the ensemble of analysis fields.A prototype sequential filter has been developed. Experiments are performed with a simulated observational network consisting of 542 radiosonde and 615 satellite-thickness profiles. Experimental results indicate that the quality of the analysis is almost independent of the number of batches (except when the ensemble is very small). This supports the use of a sequential algorithm.A parallel version of the algorithm is described and used to assimilate over 100<img border="0" src="/charent/iso_characters_mixed/lowercase/thinsp.gif"/>000 observations into a pair of 50-member ensembles. Its operation count is proportional to the number of observations, the number of analysis grid points, and the number of ensemble members. In view of the flexibility of the sequential filter and its encouraging performance on a NEC SX-4 computer, an application with a primitive equations model can now be envisioned.},

  Abstract                 = {The possibility of performing data assimilation using the flow-dependent statistics calculated from an ensemble of short-range forecasts (a technique referred to as ensemble Kalman filtering) is examined in an idealized environment. Using a three-level, quasigeostrophic, T21 model and simulated observations, experiments are performed in a perfect-model context. By using forward interpolation operators from the model state to the observations, the ensemble Kalman filter is able to utilize nonconventional observations.In order to maintain a representative spread between the ensemble members and avoid a problem of inbreeding, a pair of ensemble Kalman filters is configured so that the assimilation of data using one ensemble of short-range forecasts as background fields employs the weights calculated from the other ensemble of short-range forecasts. This configuration is found to work well: the spread between the ensemble members resembles the difference between the ensemble mean and the true state, except in the case of the smallest ensembles.A series of 30-day data assimilation cycles is performed using ensembles of different sizes. The results indicate that (i) as the size of the ensembles increases, correlations are estimated more accurately and the root-mean-square analysis error decreases, as expected, and (ii) ensembles having on the order of 100 members are sufficient to accurately describe local anisotropic, baroclinic correlation structures. Due to the difficulty of accurately estimating the small correlations associated with remote observations, a cutoff radius beyond which observations are not used, is implemented. It is found that (a) for a given ensemble size there is an optimal value of this cutoff radius, and (b) the optimal cutoff radius increases as the ensemble size increases.},

  Abstract                 = {Data assimilation is an iterative approach to the problem of estimating the state of a dynamical system using both current and past observations of the system together with a model for the system’s time evolution. Rather than solving the problem from scratch each time new observations become available, one uses the model to “forecast” the current state, using a prior state estimate (which incorporates information from past data) as the initial condition, then uses current data to correct the prior forecast to a current state estimate. This Bayesian approach is most effective when the uncertainty in both the observations and in the state estimate, as it evolves over time, are accurately quantified. In this article, we describe a practical method for data assimilation in large, spatiotemporally chaotic systems. The method is a type of “ensemble Kalman filter”, in which the state estimate and its approximate uncertainty are represented at any given time by an ensemble of system states. We discuss both the mathematical basis of this approach and its implementation; our primary emphasis is on ease of use and computational speed rather than improving accuracy over previously published approaches to ensemble Kalman filtering. We include some numerical results demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of our implementation for assimilating real atmospheric data with the global forecast model used by the \{US\} National Weather Service. },

  Abstract                 = {10.1002/qj.49712757112.abs Previous studies and different methods of estimating short-range forecast errors are summarized. Zonally and temporally averaged statistics based on differences of one- and two-day forecasts valid at the same time are presented and an attempt is made to explain many of the features by reference to dynamical concepts. Vertical correlation length-scale tends to increase with horizontal correlation scale but to be very short in the Tropics; horizontal scale is longest in the Tropics and in the stratosphere. The variations in vertical correlation are much more pronounced for largely balanced variables such as rotational wind and temperature than they are for divergent wind or humidity. The extratropics are dominated by an equivalent barotropic mode with the level of the maximum wind amplitude (and the zero crossing of the temperature correlation) being determined by the tropopause. Surface pressure is negatively correlated with low-level temperature as expected (except over the Antarctic plateau where it is positively correlated); it is also negatively correlated with temperatures near/above the tropopause in the extratropics. The covariance model used in The Met. Office Global Three-Dimensional Variational (3D-Var) Data Assimilation system represents the variation of vertical covariances with latitude reasonably well, but the longer horizontal scales in the stratosphere are not currently reproduced. The implied covariances used operationally have been modified so that the correlation length-scales, both horizontal and vertical, are somewhat shorter than those direct from the forecast differences. Recent changes to the representation are briefly described, with an indication of their impact on the forecasts. The impacts are significant relative to other changes tested, and the covariance model has played a major role in the successful implementation and subsequent improvement of our 3D-Var system.},

  Abstract                 = { Abstract The dynamical properties of potential temperature anomalies on the tropopause are analyzed for quasigeo-strophic flow on an f plane. The potential vorticity is taken to he piecewise constant, with a single discontinuity at the tropopause. The tropopause potential temperature, on scales too small to feel the lower boundary, is found to be proportional to the tropopause geopotential height. The constant of proportionality is the geometric mean of the stratospheric and tropospheric lapse rates. Results from a general circulation model are found to be in agreement with this prediction. The streamfunction associated with a combination of anomalies on the lower boundary and tropopause is also derived. The solution, determined completely by the potential temperature distributions, in general has a nonzero velocity at the lower boundary. Applying the theory to the time-mean zonal-mean jets, which must have a near-zero velocity at the ground, imposes a constraint on parameters defining the jet. The dynamical properties of the system are further elucidated using the scaling argument previously applied by Charney to geostrophic turbulence. Charney's assumption of vertical homogeneity is replaced by the assumption that the dynamics is concentrated around the tropopause. In the nonlinear cascade to small scales the Rossby number is predicted to increase with horizontal wavenumber, leading to an eventual breakdown of geostrophic balance. },

Many of these difficulties arise from its use of linearization. To overcome this limitation, the unscented transformation (UT) was developed as a method to propagate mean and covariance information through nonlinear transformations. It is more accurate, easier to implement, and uses the same order of calculations as linearization. This paper reviews the motivation, development, use, and implications of the UT.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a new formulation of the ensemble forecast sensitivity developed by Liu and Kalnay with a small correction from Li et al. The new formulation, like the original one, is tested on the simple Lorenz 40-variable model. We find that, except for short-range forecasts, the use of localization in the analysis, necessary in ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) when the number of ensemble members is much smaller than the model’s degrees of freedom, has a negative impact on the accuracy of the sensitivity. This is because the impact of an observation during the analysis (i.e. the analysis increment associated with the observation) is transported by the flow during the integration, and this is ignored when the ensemble sensitivity uses a fixed localization. To address this problem, we introduce two approaches that could be adapted to evolve the localization during the estimation of forecast sensitivity to the observations. The first one estimates the non-linear evolution of the initial localization but is computationally expensive. The second one moves the localization with a constant estimation of the group velocity. Both methods succeed in improving the ensemble estimations for longer forecasts. Overall, the adjoint and ensemble forecast impact estimations give similarly accurate results for shortrange forecasts, except that the new formulation gives an estimation of the fraction of observations that improve the forecast closer to that obtained by data denial (Observing System Experiments). For longer-range forecasts, they both deteriorate for different reasons. The adjoint sensitivity becomes noisy due to the forecast non-linearities not captured in the linear tangent model and the adjoint. The ensemble sensitivity becomes less accurate due to the use of a fixed localization, a problem that could be ameliorated with an evolving adaptive localization. Advantages of the new formulation include it being simpler than the original formulation and computationally more efficient and that it can be applied to other EnKF methods in addition to the local ensemble transform Kalman filter.Keywords: Ensemble Kalman Filter, forecast sensitivity, observation impact, skill dropout, ensemble sensitivity, data assimilation(Published: 10 October 2012)Citation: Tellus A 2012, 64, 18462, http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/tellusa.v64i0.18462},

  Abstract                 = {A major limitation of the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is that the finite ensemble size introduces sampling error into the background covariances, with severe consequences for atmospheric and oceanographic applications. The negative effects of sampling error are customarily limited by covariance localisation, which earlier studies have suggested may introduce imbalance into the system. The deleterious effects of localisation upon balance are confirmed and detailed here, with localisation producing analyses with weaker geostrophic balance and stronger divergence than are obtained using the unlocalised covariances. These imbalances reduce as the localisation radius is increased, but are argued to be large for typical settings. An improved method for calculating local covariances from an ensemble is presented, in which the localisation is performed in streamfunction-velocity potential (Ï-Ï), rather than wind component, space. Analyses using this method better preserve the balances contained within the unlocalised covariance model. This transformation further allows the option of intervariable localisation, in which the cross-covariances involving Ï, which are weak and therefore particularly subject to sampling error, are set to 0 instead of being calculated from the ensemble. The various localisations are compared in a series of identical-twin experiments, with the new localisations producing analyses that are better balanced and significantly more accurate than the usual approach. The localisation with the Ï cross-covariances set to 0 is shown to be superior for the smaller ensemble sizes but not for the larger, implying that the larger ensembles are capable of resolving some of the true Ï cross-covariance in the test system.

An OSSE provides a controlled framework for evaluating analysis and forecast errors since a truth is known. In this case, the nature run was generated and provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts as part of the international Joint OSSE project. The assimilation and forecast impact studies are carried out using a model that is different than the nature run model, thereby accounting for model error and avoiding issues with the so-called identical-twin experiments.It is found that the quality of analysis is improved substantially when going from three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3DVar) to a hybrid 3D ensemble?variational (EnVar)-based algorithm. This is especially true in terms of the analysis error reduction for wind and moisture, most notably in the tropics. Forecast impact experiments show that the hybrid-initialized forecasts improve upon the 3DVar-based forecasts for most metrics, lead times, variables, and levels. An additional experiment that utilizes 3DEnVar (100% ensemble) demonstrates that the use of a 25% static error covariance contribution does not alter the quality of hybrid analysis when utilizing the tangent-linear normal mode constraint on the total hybrid increment.},

Initialization schemes that are proposed for use are the tangent-linear normal mode constraint, weak constraint digital filter, and a combination thereof.An observing system simulation experiment is carried out to evaluate the impact of utilizing hybrid 4DEnVar with various initialization techniques. The experiments utilize a dual-resolution configuration, where the ensemble is run at roughly half the resolution of the deterministic component. It is found that by going from 3D to 4D, analysis error is reduced for most variables and levels. The inclusion of a time-invariant static covariance when used without a normal mode?based strong constraint is found to have a small, positive impact on the analysis. The experiments show that the weak constraint digital filter degrades the quality of analysis, due to the use of hourly states to prescribe high-frequency noise. It is found that going from 3D to 4D ensemble covariances has a relatively larger impact in the extratropics, whereas the original inclusion of ensemble-based covariances was found to have the largest impact in the tropics. The improvements found in going from 3D to 4D covariances in the hybrid EnVar formulation are not as large as was found in Part I from the original introduction of the hybrid algorithm. The analyses generated by the 4D hybrid scheme are found to yield slightly improved extratropical height and wind forecasts, with smaller impacts on other variables and in general in the tropics.},

This NAVDAS-AR-hybrid scheme linearly combines the static NAVDAS-AR initial background error covariance with a covariance derived from an 80-member flow-dependent ensemble. The ensemble members are generated using the ensemble transform technique with a (three-dimensional variational data assimilation) 3D-Var-based estimate of analysis error variance. The ensemble covariances are localized using an efficient algorithm enabled via a separable formulation of the localization matrix. The authors describe the development and testing of this scheme, which allows for assimilation experiments using differing linear combinations of the static and flow-dependent background error covariances. The tests are performed for two months of summer and two months of winter using operational model resolution and the operational observational dataset, which is dominated by satellite observations. Results show that the hybrid mode data assimilation scheme significantly reduces the forecast error across a wide range of variables and regions. The improvements were particularly pronounced for tropical winds. The verification against radiosondes showed a greater than 0.5% reduction in vector wind RMS differences in areas of statistical significance. The verification against self-analysis showed a greater than 1% reduction from verifying against analyses between 2- and 5-day lead time at all eight vertical levels examined in areas of statistical significance. Using the Navy's summary of verification results, the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS) scorecard, the improvements resulted in a score (+1) that justifies a major system upgrade.},

Approximately 90 h of droplet data were recorded simultaneously at 5 m and 30 m above the ground throughout the life cycle of 11 fogs during 1980 and 1981. This large data set was used to develop new parameterizations of the extinction coefficient and the mean droplet terminal velocity in terms of liquid water content and droplet concentration for fogs with liquid water contents greater than 0.018 g m&#8722;3. The advection fog data show an excellent correlation of 95&#37; between the extinction coefficient and liquid water content. The regression line for these two quantities is more nearly linear than found by other investigators. The correlation between the mean droplet terminal velocity and various microphysical parameters is not as high as that for the extinction coefficient and liquid water content. The best correlation (75&#37;) is found between mean droplet terminal velocity and a power function of the ratio of liquid water content and concentration of droplets greater than 2.5 &#956;m in diameter. However, since the concentration of such droplets is highly variable, and not easily measured, it is suggested that a constant mean droplet terminal velocity of 1.9 cm s&#8722;1 be used in numerical fog prediction models.},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate numerical prediction of fluid flows requires accurate initial conditions. Monte Carlo methods have become a popular and realizable approach to estimating the initial conditions necessary for forecasting, and have generally been divided into two classes: stochastic filters and deterministic filters. Both filters strive to achieve the error statistics predicted by optimal linear estimation, but accomplish their goal in different fashions, the former by way of random number realizations and the latter via explicit mathematical transformations. Inspection of the update process of each filter in a one-dimensional example and in a two-dimensional dynamical system offers a geometric interpretation of how their behavior changes as nonlinearity becomes appreciable. This interpretation is linked to three ensemble assessment diagnostics: rms analysis error, ensemble rank histograms, and measures of ensemble skewness and kurtosis. Similar expressions of these diagnostics exist in a hierarchy of models. The geometric interpretation and the ensemble diagnostics suggest that both filters perform as expected in a linear regime, but that stochastic filters can better withstand regimes with nonlinear error growth.},

In both algorithms, the original constrained problem is transformed by appropriate modifications into one unconstrained problem, or into a sequence of unconstrained problems. The main advantage of proceeding in this way is that the new unconstrained problems can be solved by classical descent algorithms, thus avoiding the need of directly solving the Euler-Lagrange equations of the original constrained problem.The first algorithm presented in the augmented lagrangian algorithm. It generalizes the more classical penalty and duality algorithms. The second algorithm, inspired from optimal control techniques, is based on an appropriate use of an adjoint dynamical equation, and seems to be particularly well adapted to the assimilation of observations distributed in time. Simple numerical examples show the ability of these algorithms to solve non-linear minimization problems of the type encountered in meteorology.

  Abstract                 = {A long-term goal in variational data assimilation is to improve the anisotropy of background error correlations. One way to achieve anisotropic correlations is to introduce spatial deformations. This deformation can be specified a priori for instance by using the geostrophic transform (GT) as introduced by Desroziers (1997). The deformation can also be estimated from a purely statistical point of view (Michel, 2013a). The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of such spatial deformation techniques for the use of background error modelling. A large ensemble of variational assimilations with perturbed observations is set up on a case study with the global ARPEGE model. An anisotropy index and a length scale diagnostic are defined to compare objectively the effectiveness of the deformations. This effectiveness is measured as the ability of the inverse spatial deformations to make the correlations more isotropic or more homogeneous. The results are shown to depend on the vertical level and on the variable. Generally, the statistical deformation is able to reduce the anisotropy while the GT is giving much smaller improvements that are, in this case study, confined to the frontal area of an extratropical cyclone.Keywords: data assimilation, anisotropy, background error, ensemble, spatial deformation(Published: 21 October 2014)Citation: Tellus A 2014, 66, 23984, http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/tellusa.v66.23984},

Both techniques provide an estimate of the localization function for an observation?s impact on a state variable with few a priori assumptions about the localization function. The ELF localizations can have values larger than 1.0 at small distances, indicating that this technique addresses localization but also can correct the prior ensemble spread in the same way as a variance inflation when needed. OSSEs using ELF localizations generally have smaller root-mean-square error (RMSE) than the optimal Gaspari and Cohn (GC) localization function obtained by empirically tuning the GC width. The localization functions estimated by the GGF are broader than those from the ELF, and the OSSEs with the GGF localization generally have larger RMSE than the optimal GC localization function. The GGFs are too broad because of spurious correlation biases that occur in the OSSEs. These errors can be reduced by using a stochastic EnKF with perturbed observations instead of a deterministic EAKF.},

  Abstract                 = {AbstractCovariance localization is an essential component of ensemble-based data assimilation systems for large geophysical applications with limited ensemble sizes. For integral observations like the satellite radiances, where the concepts of location or vertical distance are not well defined, vertical localization in observation space is not as straightforward as in model space. The detailed differences between model space and observation space localizations are examined using a real radiance observation. Counterintuitive analysis increments can be obtained with model space localization; the magnitude of the increment can increase and the increment can change sign when the localization scale decreases. This occurs when there are negative background-error covariances and a predominately positive forward operator. Too narrow model space localization can neglect the negative background-error covariances and result in the counterintuitive analysis increments. An idealized 1D model with integral observations and known true error covariance is then used to compare errors resulting from model space and observation space localizations. Although previous studies have suggested that observation space localization is inferior to model space localization for satellite radiances, the results from the 1D model reveal that observation space localization can have advantages over model space localization when there are negative background-error covariances. Differences between model space and observation space localizations disappear as ensemble size, observation error variance, and localization scale increase. Thus, large ensemble sizes and vertical localization length scales may be needed to more effectively assimilate radiance observations.},

  Abstract                 = {Two independent ground-based passive remote sensing methods are used to retrieve lower-tropospheric temperature and humidity profiles in clear-sky cases. A simulation study for two distinctly different climatic zones is performed to evaluate the accuracies of a standard microwave profiler &#91;humidity and temperature profiler (HATPRO)&#93; and an infrared spectrometer &#91;Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI)&#93; by applying a unified optimal estimation scheme to each instrument. Different measurement modes for each instrument are also evaluated in which the retrieval uses different spectral channels and observational view angles. In addition, both instruments have been combined into the same physically consistent retrieval scheme to evaluate the differences between a combined retrieval relative to the single-instrument retrievals. In general, retrievals derived from only infrared measurements yield superior RMS error and bias to retrievals derived only from microwave measurements. The AERI retrievals show high potential, especially for retrieving humidity in the boundary layer, where accuracies are on the order of 0.25&#8211;0.5 g m&#8722;3 for a central European climate. In the lowest 500 m the retrieval accuracies for temperature from elevation-scanning microwave measurements and spectral infrared measurements are very similar (0.2&#8211;0.6 K). Above this level the accuracies of the AERI retrieval are significantly more accurate (&#60;1 K RMSE below 4 km). The inclusion of microwave measurements to the spectral infrared measurements within a unified physical retrieval scheme only results in improvements in the high-humidity tropical climate. However, relative to the HATPRO retrieval, the accuracy of the AERI retrieval is more sensitive to changes in the measurement uncertainty. The discussed results are drawn from a subset of &#8220;pristine&#8221; clear-sky cases: in the general case in which clouds and aerosols are present, the combined HATPRO&#8211;AERI retrieval algorithm is expected to yield much more beneficial results.},

  Abstract                 = {The extended Kalman filter is presented as a good approximation to the optimal assimilation of observations into a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model, as long as the evolution of errors stays close to linear. The error probability distributions are approximated by Gaussians, characterized by their mean and covariance. The full nonlinear forecast model is used to propagate the mean, and a linear model (not necessarily tangent to the full model) the covariances. Since it is impossible to determine the covariances in detail, physically based assumptions about their behaviour must be made; for instance, three-dimensional balance relationships are used. The linear model can be thought of as extending the covariance relationships to the time dimension. Incremental four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) is derived as a practical implementation of the extended Kalman filter, optimally using these modelled covariances for a finite time window. It is easy to include a simplified model of forecast errors in the representation. This Kalman filter based paradigm differs from more traditional derivations of 4D-Var in attempting to estimate the mean, rather than the mode, of the posterior probability density function. The latter is difficult for a NWP system representing scales which exhibit chaotic behaviour over the period of interest.The covariance modelling assumptions often result in a null space of error modes with little variance. It is argued that this is as important as the variance and correlation structures usually examined, since the implied constraints allow optimal use of observations giving gradient and tendency information.Difficulties arise in the approach when the NWP system is capable of resolving significant structures (such as convective cells) not always determined by the observations. © Crown copyright, 2003.

  Abstract                 = {Some practical problems in objective analysis for numerical weather prediction are best solved by using nonlinear analysis equations. They include the existence of nonlinear prior constraints on the analysis, and the use of observations which are nonlinearly related to the analysis parameters, or which have non-Gaussian error distributions. Bayesian methods are used to derive equations for the optimal (maximum likelihood) nonlinear analysis. It is shown how to incorporate a strong constraint that the four-dimensional evolution of the analysis should be consistent with a NWP model, by reduction of the control variable to the space-dimensioned initial field for the model. The iterative solution of the nonlinear analysis equation then involves the integration of the NWP model, and its adjoint.The behaviour of the nonlinear equations is demonstrated with a simple one-dimensional shallow-water model. It is shown that time-tendency information, and indirect observations such as wind speed, or the movement of a tracer, can be used in the analysis. The resulting forecasts are better than those made from an analysis from a traditional analysis-forecast cycle. The nonlinear method is shown to be capable of ‘moving’ a discontinuity similar to a front, to fit observations defining its position, thus giving an analysis with more detail than would be expected from the spatial resolution of the observations. The incorporation of additional nonlinear constraints, such as that used in initialization, is demonstrated. The method can be used to effectively reject observations with gross errors, by specifying a non-Gaussian error distribution. However, this generates multiple minima which complicate the search for the best analysis, so the complex decision-taking algorithms associated with other methods of quality control are not avoided.The convergence properties of iterative methods of solution, and approximations to the ideal equations, are studied, in order to provide some indication as to whether the nonlinear effects might be allowed for in a practical analysis scheme.},

Both are four-dimensional variational methods, using a hybrid combination of a fixed climatological model of background error covariances with localized covariances from an ensemble of current forecasts designed to describe the structure of ?errors of the day.? The fundamental difference between the methods is their modeling of the time evolution of errors within each data assimilation window: 4DVar uses a linear model and its adjoint and 4DEnVar uses a localized linear combination of nonlinear forecasts. Both hybrid-4DVar and hybrid-4DEnVar beat their three-dimensional versions, which are equivalent, in NWP trials. With settings based on the current operational system, hybrid-4DVar performs better than hybrid-4DEnVar. Idealized experiments designed to compare the time evolution of covariances in the methods are described: the basic 4DEnVar represents the evolution of ensemble errors as well as 4DVar. However, 4DVar also represents the evolution of errors from the climatological covariances, whereas 4DEnVar does not. This difference is the main cause of the superiority of hybrid-4DVar. Another difference is that the authors? 4DVar explicitly penalizes rapid variations in the analysis increment trajectory, while the authors? 4DEnVar contains no dynamical constaints on imbalance. The authors describe a four-dimensional incremental analysis update (4DIAU) method that filters out the high-frequency oscillations introduced by the poorly balanced 4DEnVar increments. Possible methods for improving hybrid-4DEnVar are discussed.},

The hypothesis is investigated with a simple mathematical model. An equation whose dependent variables are ensemble averages of the âerror energyâ in separate scales of motion is derived from the vorticity equation which governs two-dimensional incompressible flow. Solutions of the equation are determined by numerical integration, for cases where the horizontal extent and total energy of the system are comparable to those of the earth's atomsphere.It is found that each scale of motion possesses an intrinsic finite range of predictability, provided that the total energy of the system does not fall off too rapidly with decreasing wave length. With the chosen values of the constants, âcumulus-scaleâ motions can be predicted about one hour, âsynoptic-scaleâ motions a few days, and the largest scales a few weeks in advance.

  Abstract                 = {Finite systems of deterministic ordinary nonlinear differential equations may be designed to represent forced dissipative hydrodynamic flow. Solutions of these equations can be identified with trajectories in phase space. For those systems with bounded solutions, it is found that nonperiodic solutions are ordinarily unstable with respect to small modifications, so that slightly differing initial states can evolve into considerably different states. Systems with bounded solutions are shown to possess bounded numerical solutions. A simple system representing cellular convection is solved numerically. All of the solutions are found to be unstable, and almost all of them are nonperiodic. The feasibility of very-long-range weather prediction is examined in the light of these results.},

  Abstract                 = {Anticipating the opportunity to make supplementary observations at locations that can depend upon the current weather situation, the question is posed as to what strategy should be adopted to select the locations, if the greatest improvement in analyses and forecasts is to be realized. To seek a preliminary answer, the authors introduce a model consisting of 40 ordinary differential equations, with the dependent variables representing values of some atmospheric quantity at 40 sites spaced equally about a latitude circle. The equations contain quadratic, linear, and constant terms representing advection, dissipation, and external forcing. Numerical integration indicates that small errors (differences between solutions) tend to double in about 2 days. Localized errors tend to spread eastward as they grow, encircling the globe after about 14 days. In the experiments presented, 20 consecutive sites lie over the ocean and 20 over land. A particular solution is chosen as the true weather. Every 6 h observations are made, consisting of the true weather plus small random errors, at every land site, and at one ocean site to be selected by the strategy being considered. An analysis is then made, consisting of observations where observations are made and previously made 6-h forecasts elsewhere. Forecasts are made for each site at ranges from 6 h to 10 days. In all forecasts, a slightly weakened external forcing is used to simulate the model error. This process continues for 5 years, and mean-square forecast errors at each site at each range are accumulated. Strategies that attempt to locate the site where the current analysis, as made without a supplementary observation, is most greatly in error are found to perform better than those that seek the oceanic site to which a chosen land site is most sensitive at a chosen range. Among the former are strategies based on the &#8220;breeding&#8221; method, a variant of singular vectors, and ensembles of &#8220;replicated&#8221; observations; the last of these outperforms the others. The authors speculate as to the applicability of these findings to models with more realistic dynamics or without extensive regions devoid of routine observations, and to the real world.},

However, it is shown in this paper that this practical definition of the cost function is not correct if the CVT uses a square root of the background error covariance matrix that is not square. Fortunately, it is then shown that there is a manifold of the control space for which this flaw has no impact, and that most minimizers used in practice precisely work in this manifold. It is also shown that both correct and practical transformed cost functions have the same minimum. This explains more rigorously why the CVT is working in practice. The case of a singular is finally detailed, showing that the practical cost function still reaches the best linear unbiased estimate (BLUE).},

Theoretical and experimental evidence shows that if optimal weights are used, localized-hybridized sample covariances are always more accurate than their localized-only counterparts, whatever the static covariance matrix specified for the hybridization. Experimental results obtained using a 1000-member ensemble as a reference show that the method developed in this paper can efficiently provide localization and hybridization coefficients consistent with the variable, vertical level, and ensemble size. Spatially heterogeneous optimization is shown to improve the accuracy of the filtered covariances, and consideration of both vertical and horizontal covariances is proven to have an impact on the hybridization coefficients.},

It appears that the physical processes in fog layers lead to very specific balances between control variables as well as much shorter vertical correlation length-scales at low levels in background-error covariances. In order to spread the information from surface and satellite observations with adequate structures in fog areas, a binary heterogeneity based on the use of geographical masks is added to the background-error covariances. After the elimination of discontinuities at the mask borders, the positive impact of this formalism on the analysis-increment structure is discussed. Impact studies based on long-term real cases indicate that the global impact is closely related to the quality of the fog mask, for which future improvements are awaited.

The dependence of error covariances on the weather situation is illustrated for low-level specific humidity in particular, which is associated, for example, with large variance values over the Mediterranean area. While this large-scale contrast is visible in both AROME and ARPEGE ensembles, differences between the two ensembles are also apparent as expected, for instance due to resolution differences. The effects of sampling noise are investigated by comparing independent six-member and 84 member estimates of variances and correlation length-scales. While the six-member ensemble is able to capture some of the signal of interest, spatial filtering techniques seem to be useful in order to reduce estimation errors.},

  Abstract                 = {In data assimilation (DA) schemes for numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems, the estimation of forecast error covariances is a key point to get some flow dependency. As shown in previous studies, ensemble data assimilation methods are the most accurate for this task. However, their huge computational cost raises a strong limitation to the ensemble size. Consequently, covariances estimated with small ensembles are affected by random sampling errors. The aim of this study is to develop a theory of covariance filtering in order to remove most of the sampling noise while keeping the signal of interest and then to use it in the DA scheme of a real NWP system. This first part of a two-part study presents the theoretical aspects of such criteria for optimal filtering based on the merging of the theories of optimal linear filtering and of sample centered moments estimation. Its strength relies on the use of sample estimated quantities and filter output only. These criteria pave the way for new algorithms and interesting applications for NWP. Two of them are detailed here: spatial filtering of variances and covariance localization. Results obtained in an idealized 1D analytical framework are shown for illustration. Applications on real forecast error covariances deduced from ensembles at convective scale are discussed in a companion paper.},

In this second part, the theory is tested with real background error covariances computed using a large ensemble data assimilation (EDA) at the convective scale coupled with a large EDA at the global scale, based respectively on the Applications of Research to Operations at Mesoscale (AROME) and ARPEGE operational NWP systems. Background error variances estimated with a subset of this ensemble are filtered and evaluated against values obtained with the remaining members, which are considered as an independent reference. Algorithms presented in Part I show relevant results, with the homogeneous filtering being quasi optimal. Heterogeneous filtering is also successfully tested with different local criteria, yet at a higher computational cost, showing the full generality of the method.

It seeks to identify clear channels within a measured spectrum, rather than the locations of completely clear spectra. Applied to simulated cloudy spectra, the scheme is able to detect clear channels with residual cloud contamination better than (i.e. less than) 0.2 K in many channels, and is thus considered sufficiently stringent for numerical weather-prediction applications. The scheme has been applied to spectra measured by the Advanced InfraRed Sounder and, whilst a quantitative validation is more difficult with real data (without true clear radiances), it is found to perform well compared with coincident imagery.

  Abstract                 = {Covariance models are widely used in data assimilation, especially when a variational formulation is chosen. Autocovariances for each variable are generally split into variance and correlation parts. Despite recent progress, the correlations are still often modelled as space-stationary. A novel approach is introduced in this paper, where background error correlations are approximated by the spatial deformation of a stationary correlation model. The statistical calibration of this model involves estimating the deformation, its inverse and the stationary correlations. Leveraging previous work in the computer vision community, the problem is first described in two dimensions. Directional wavelets, also called warplets, are able to measure the energy of a random process at different scales and orientations. The texture gradient equation relates the wavelet analysis of a deformed process to local metric changes. From a few realizations, it is therefore possible to estimate local variations of the Jacobian of the deformation. This paper shows that a deformation can be recovered from the deformation gradient by solving partial differential equations of elliptic nature with inhomogeneous coefficients. The choice of boundary conditions is discussed. The method is then applied to the modelling of background error correlations in a limited area model. Qualitative intercomparison with other horizontal correlation models frequently used in atmospheric data assimilation, such as the diffusion equation or the diagonal assumption in a wavelet basis, suggests that the approach is also able to represent anisotropy to a fair degree.

  Abstract                 = {We introduce the use of spatial deformations for the modelling of background-error correlations in data assimilation with large dimensions of the state variable. Usually, the background-error covariance matrix is split into standard deviations and correlations. In this framework, a proposal is made to model the correlations as the space deformation of a stationary correlation model. The âshape from textureâ approach introduced in the computer vision community is an algorithm that estimates the relative deformation gradient and relies on a continuous wavelet analysis. It is also shown that it is possible to estimate the deformation gradient from a simple length-scale diagnosis and both approaches are compared. Then, a change of coordinate is derived from the numerical integration of the deformation gradient, opening the path to build the approximate correlation model.Many variational data-assimilation schemes use a square-root form to construct the background-error covariance matrix and it is shown how the deformation can be easily included in such a formulation. This approach is of interest in allowing for objective geographical inhomogeneities of the structure functions. The deformed matrix is of slightly reduced rank, but this can be compensated for by a regularization. There is no need for additional normalization as is the case when one models correlations with wavelet frames or recursive filters. The algorithm has a similar computational cost to these two other approaches. Results are illustrated with real data from one-dimensional temperature forecast errors produced by an operational atmospheric model. Copyright © 2012 Royal Meteorological Society},

  Abstract                 = {Correlation models are required in data assimilation to characterize the error structures of variables defined on a numerical grid. Previous studies have shown that the diffusion equation can provide a flexible and computationally efficient framework for representing grid-point correlation functions for problems of large dimension such as those encountered in atmospheric or ocean variational data assimilation. In this article, an implicit formulation of the diffusion-based correlation model is presented as an alternative to the traditional explicit formulation. The implicit formulation is analyzed in detail for the one-dimensional (1D) problem and shown to be closely related to the first-order recursive filter. Integrating a 1D implicit diffusion equation, with constant coefficient, over M steps is shown to be equivalent to convolving the initial condition with an Mth order auto-regressive (AR) function. Expressions for both the length-scale of the AR function and the normalization factor required to generate unit-amplitude (correlation) functions are given in terms of M and the diffusion coefficient. For a fixed length-scale the Gaussian function, which is the only function that can be represented using an explicit formulation of the constant-coefficient diffusion equation, is the limiting case as M â â of the AR functions generated by the implicit diffusion equation. Generalizations of the diffusion model are discussed to allow for different shapes in the correlation function and spatial variations in the length-scale. An important consequence of employing spatially varying length-scales is that the normalization factors are no longer constant. Approximate expressions for the normalization factors are evaluated in terms of their effectiveness to provide viable alternatives to estimates produced using expensive algorithms such as randomization. Boundary conditions can distort the correlation functions near the boundaries and significantly degrade the accuracy of the analytical expressions for the normalization factors. These problems can be avoided through a straightforward extension of the diffusion model that makes the boundaries effectively transparent, although the solution comes at the expense of an extra application of the diffusion equation. Extensions of the method to construct two- and three-dimensional correlation models are discussed. Copyright © 2010 Royal Meteorological Society},

  Abstract                 = {In variational data assimilation systems, background error covariances are often estimated from a temporal and spatial average. For a limited area model such as the Aire Limited Adaptation Dynamique Developpment International (ALADIN)/France, the spatial average is calculated over the regional computation domain, which covers western Europe. The purpose of this study is to revise the temporal stationarity assumption by diagnosing time variations of such regionally averaged covariances. This is done through examination of covariance changes as a function of season (winter versus summer), day (in connection with the synoptic situation), and hour (related to the diurnal cycle), with the ALADIN/France regional ensemble Three-Dimensional Variational analysis (3D-Var) system. In summer, compared to winter, average error variances are larger, and spatial correlation functions are sharper horizontally but broader vertically. Daily changes in covariances are particularly strong during the winter period, with larger variances and smaller-scale error structures when an unstable low-pressure system is present in the regional domain. Diurnal variations are also significant in the boundary layer in particular, and, as expected, they tend to be more pronounced in summer. Moreover, the comparison between estimates provided by two independent ensembles indicates that these covariance time variations are estimated in a robust way from a six-member ensemble. All these results support the idea of representing these time variations by using a real-time ensemble assimilation system.},

  Abstract                 = {This study focuses on diagnosing variations of background-error covariances between precipitating and non-precipitating areas, and on presenting a heterogeneous covariance formulation to represent these variations in a variational framework. The context of this work is the assimilation of observations linked to precipitation (radar data especially) in the AROME model, which has been running operationally at MÃ©tÃ©o-France since December 2008 over French territory with a 2.5 km horizontal resolution. This system uses multivariate background-error covariances deduced from an ensemble-based method. At first, such statistics have been computed for 17 precipitating cases using an ensemble of AROME forecasts coupled with an ALADIN ensemble assimilation. Results, obtained from 3 h forecast differences performed separately for non-precipitating and precipitating columns, display large discrepancies in error variances, correlation lengths and the correlations between humidity, temperature and divergence errors. These results argue in favour of including heterogeneous background-error covariances in AROME incremental 3D-Var, allowing different covariances to be used in regions with different meteorological patterns. Such a method enables us to get increments more adequately structured in those regions, and thus potentially to make better use of observations in a data assimilation system. The implementation consists of expressing the analysis increment as the sum of two terms, one for precipitating areas and the other for non-precipitating areas, making use of a mask that defines rainy regions. This implies a doubling in the size of the control variable and of the gradient of the cost function. The feasibility of this method is shown through experiments with four isolated observations.

This system includes, among other observation types, radiances from AMSU-A, AMSU-B, HIRS and SEVIRI radiometers. SEVIRI is on board the geostationary platform Meteosat-8 and provides continuous observations in space and in time over the region of interest at several wavelengths, while the others, which are on board polar-orbiting satellites, have poorer temporal and horizontal resolutions but a better spectral resolution than SEVIRI. Observing System Experiments (OSEs) have been performed with the operational 3D-Var to assess the impact of such satellite data on analyses and on forecasts. DFS (Degrees of Freedom for Signal) have been computed and have shown the complementarity between WV channels from the different radiometers. In the operational version of the 3D-Var, DFS values show that analyses are strongly controlled by SEVIRI data in the mid to high troposphere. This is consistent with the large number of assimilated SEVIRI radiances. HIRS and AMSU-B WV data would provide more information if SEVIRI data were not assimilated and if ATOVS data were used with a higher density. However, using ATOVS data with a higher horizontal resolution makes the analyses more dependent on these data, and it does not appear to be beneficial in this particular context, probably because of a non-optimal bias correction. In that case however, the individual impact of each pixel decreases because of the horizontal correlation lengths of the structure functions. Forecast scores and predicted precipitation patterns display the positive impact of SEVIRI data. Copyright © 2007 Royal Meteorological Society},

Collapses have occurred frequently in history, often followed by centuries of economic, intellectual, and population decline. Many different natural and social phenomena have been invoked to explain specific collapses, but a general explanation remains elusive. In this paper, we build a human population dynamics model by adding accumulated wealth and economic inequality to a predator–prey model of humans and nature. The model structure, and simulated scenarios that offer significant implications, are explained. Four equations describe the evolution of Elites, Commoners, Nature, and Wealth. The model shows Economic Stratification or Ecological Strain can independently lead to collapse, in agreement with the historical record. The measure “Carrying Capacity” is developed and its estimation is shown to be a practical means for early detection of a collapse. Mechanisms leading to two types of collapses are discussed. The new dynamics of this model can also reproduce the irreversible collapses found in history. Collapse can be avoided, and population can reach a steady state at maximum carrying capacity if the rate of depletion of nature is reduced to a sustainable level and if resources are distributed equitably.},

  Abstract                 = {Alignment errors [i.e., cases where coherent structures (?features?) of clouds or precipitation in the background have position errors] can lead to large and non-Gaussian background errors. Assimilation of cloud-affected radiances using additive increments derived by variational and/or ensemble methods can be problematic in these situations. To address this problem, the Feature Calibration and Alignment technique (FCA) is used here for correcting position errors by displacing background fields. A set of two-dimensional displacement vectors is applied to forecast fields to improve the alignment of features in the forecast and observations. These displacement vectors are obtained by a nonlinear minimization of a cost function that measures the misfit to observations, along with a number of additional constraints (e.g., smoothness and nondivergence of the displacement vectors) to prevent unphysical solutions. The method was applied in an idealized case using Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) forecast fields for Hurricane Katrina. Application of the displacement vectors to the three-dimensional WRF fields resulted in improved predicted hurricane positions in subsequent forecasts. When applied to a set of high-resolution forecasts of deep moist convection over the central United States, displacements are able to efficiently characterize part of the ensemble spread. To test its application as an analysis preprocessor, FCA was applied to a real-data case of cloud-affected radiances of one of the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) channels. The displaced background resulted in an improved fit to the AIRS observations in all cloud-sensitive channels.},

  Abstract                 = {The Feature Calibration and Alignment technique (FCA) has been developed to characterize errors that a human would ascribe to a change in the position or intensity of a coherent feature, such as a hurricane. Here the feature alignment part of FCA is implemented in the Weather Research and Forecasting Data Assimilation system (WRFDA) to correct position errors in background fields and tested in simulation for the case of Hurricane Katrina (2005). The displacement vectors determined by feature alignment can be used to explain part of the background error and make the residual background errors smaller and more Gaussian. Here a set of 2D displacement vectors to improve the alignment of features in the forecast and observations is determined by solving the usual variational data assimilation problem?simultaneously minimizing the misfit to observations and a constraint on the displacements. This latter constraint is currently implemented by hijacking the usual background term for the midlevel u- and ?-wind components. The full model fields are then aligned using a procedure that minimizes dynamical imbalances by displacing only conserved or quasi-conserved quantities. Simulation experiments show the effectiveness of these procedures in correcting gross position errors and improving short-term forecasts. Compared to earlier experiments, even this initial implementation of feature alignment produces improved short-term forecasts. Adding the calculation of displacements to WRFDA advances the key contribution of FCA toward mainstream implementation since all observations with a corresponding observation operator may be used and the existing methodology for estimating the background error covariances may be used to refine the displacement error covariances.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper deals with the unbiased estimation of the correlation of two variates having a bivariate normal distribution (Sec. 2), and of the intraclass correlation, i.e., the common correlation coefficient of a $p$-variate normal distribution with equal variances and equal covariances (Sec. 3). In both cases, the estimator has the following properties. It is a function of a complete sufficient statistic and is therefore the unique (except for sets of probability zero) minimum variance unbiased estimator. Its range is the region of possible values of the estimated quantity. It is a strictly increasing function of the usual estimator differing from it only by terms of order $1/n$ and consequently having the same asymptotic distribution. Since the unbiased estimators are cumbersome in form in that they are expressed as series or integrals, tables are included giving the unbiased estimators as functions of the usual estimators. In Sec. 4 we give an unbiased estimator of the squared multiple correlation. It has the properties mentioned in the second paragraph except that it may be negative, which the squared multiple correlation cannot. In each case the estimator is obtained by inverting a Laplace transform. We are grateful to W. H. Kruskal and L. J. Savage for very helpful comments and suggestions, and to R. R. Blough for his able computations.},

In particular, two new and simple formulae are introduced, which only require the computation of correlation with a single point for a given direction. It is then shown in a 1D heterogeneous context that all formulations lead to similar realistic length-scale values, and that they represent geographical variations rather well.The estimation of length-scales within a finite ensemble is also studied. While a positive bias occurs when the ensemble size is too small, the standard deviation of the length-scale estimation is shown to be the main influence on the estimation error. The spatial structure of sampling noise is then diagnosed, and effects of spatial filtering techniques on the bias and standard deviation are illustrated.Finally, an ensemble of perturbed forecasts from a global NWP model is used, showing a real application example.

  Abstract                 = {As the background-error covariance matrix is a key component of any assimilation system, its modelling is an important step. Usually, this matrix is decomposed into correlations and standard deviations matrices. An interesting method for modelling the correlation matrix of the background error for complex geometry, like an ocean grid, consists in computing correlation functions using a diffusion operator. The background-error correlation functions can be estimated for example from an ensemble of perturbed forecasts. The diffusion operator is able to represent heterogeneous correlation functions at a reasonable numerical cost. But a first challenge resides in the determination of the local diffusion tensor corresponding to the local correlation function. Then the second challenge resides in the determination of the normalization to make sure that the matrix modelled through the diffusion operator is a correlation matrix. In this article, we propose to build a background-error correlation matrix using a diffusion operator based on a local diffusion tensor. The estimation of this local tensor is performed using an ensemble of perturbed forecasts. A validation within a randomization method illustrates the feasibility and the accuracy of the proposed method. In particular, it is shown that the local geographical variations of diagnosed correlation functions (through an ensemble of perturbed forecast) are well represented.This is first illustrated in an analytical one-dimensional framework. In that context, the diffusion field and the normalization field are deduced from a given correlation length-scale field. The resulting length-scales are shown to correspond to the initial length-scale when the given length-scale field spectrum is red. The approximate normalization, computed from the local length-scale, is close to the true normalization under the same condition of a red spectrum.Then, the method is illustrated in a real context using an ensemble of perturbed forecasts from the MOCAGE-PALM assimilation system. In that case, length-scale and anisotropy diagnosis reveal the complexity of the correlation of stratospheric ozone forecast errors. The local diffusion tensor deduced from these diagnoses is shown be able to represent such an existing heterogeneity and anisotropy. As in the one-dimensional case, the approximate normalization, based on the local diffusion tensor, appears to be a really good approximation of the true normalization.

  Abstract                 = {Background-error variances estimated from a small-size ensemble of data assimilations need to be filtered because of the associated sampling noise. Previous studies showed that objective spectral filtering is efficient in reducing this noise, while preserving relevant features to a large extent. However, since such filters are homogeneous, they tend to smooth small-scale structures of interest. In many applications, nonlinear thresholding of wavelet coefficients has proved to be an efficient technique for denoising signals. This algorithm proceeds by thresholding the wavelet coefficients of the noisy signal using an estimated threshold. This is equivalent to applying an adaptive local spatial filtering. A quasi-optimal value for the threshold can be computed from the noise variance. We show that the statistical properties of the sampling noise associated with the estimation of background-error variances can be used to calculate the noise level and the appropriate threshold value. This method is first applied to 1D academic examples, with emphasis on correlated and heterogeneous noises. This approach is shown to outperform the commonly used homogeneous filters, since it automatically adapts to the local structure of the signal. We also show that this technique compares favourably to a heterogeneous diffusion-based filter, with the advantage of requiring less trial-and-error tuning. These results are next confirmed in a more realistic 2D problem, using the Arome-France convective-scale model.},

The aim is to study their behavior in the simple nonlinear chaotic Lorenz system, in the hope of getting some insight into more complex models. It is seen that these filters perform satisfactory, but the new filters introduced have the advantage of being less costly. This is achieved through the concept of second-order-exact drawing and the selective error correction, parallel to the tangent space of the attractor of the system (which is of low dimension). Also introduced is the use of a forgetting factor, which could enhance significantly the filter stability in this nonlinear context.},

  Abstract                 = {Since July 2008, a variational ensemble data assimilation system has been used operationally at MÃ©tÃ©o-France to provide background error variances âof the dayâ to the operational 4D-Var assimilation of the global ArpÃ¨ge model. The current ensemble is run in a perfect model framework and estimated variances are inflated âofflineâ (i.e. after the ensemble has been completed) to account for model errors. The inflation coefficient is tuned according to a posteriori diagnostics relative to the minimum of the cost function. In this study, the âofflineâ variance inflation is replaced by an âonlineâ multiplicative inflation of 6 h forecast perturbations after each step of 6 h model integration. This allows the inflation information to be accounted for in the production of background perturbations with realistic amplitudes for the perturbed analysis steps.In the case of a perfect model approach, background error standard deviations are underestimated by a factor of approximately two. When using online inflation to avoid this kind of mismatch, background perturbations after 6 h of model integration are inflated by around 10%. Examination of error spectra and of standard deviation maps indicates that the increase of variance is somewhat larger for synoptic scales and in data-sparse regions with dynamically active systems such as in the extratropical part of the Southern Hemisphere. Moreover, the reduction of background perturbation amplitude during the analysis step is more pronounced, especially for large-scale variables such as temperature and surface pressure.Parallel analysis and forecast experiments indicate that the covariance estimates provided by the inflated background perturbations have a neutral to positive impact on the forecast quality, in addition to being more consistent with innovation-based estimates.

  Abstract                 = {A variational ensemble assimilation has been developed at MÃ©tÃ©o-France to provide errors âof the dayâ to the operational 4D-Var assimilation of the ArpÃ¨ge model. In the reference ArpÃ¨ge system (operational until April 2010), ensemble-based variances are used for vorticity and for the associated balanced parts of mass and divergence, while variances of the unbalanced parts remain static and horizontally homogeneous, and humidity variances are calculated with an empirical flow-dependent formula. This article presents some diagnostic and impact studies to examine the effects of extending the specification of flow-dependent ensemble-based variances to all variables in the minimization. The extended flow-dependent variances derived from the ensemble are first compared with the reference system values. It is observed that the flow-dependence of local variances of all variables tends to be strengthened with the extended specification. This is particularly noticeable for surface pressure variances in the vicinity of mid-latitude storms and tropical cyclones. The impact of using variances âof the dayâ for all analysis variables is examined through analysis/forecast experiments over a 1-month period. The global impact of this extended specification is neutral to positive. Results suggest that the new variances are likely to produce localized (in space and time) positive impacts, most likely connected with dynamically active systems. This is supported by a case study of an intense storm that hit the northern part of France on February 2009. It is observed that the extended flow-dependent information improves the 48 h surface pressure forecast, by correcting both position and intensity errors.

  Abstract                 = {It is common to compute background-error variances from an ensemble of forecasts, in order to calculate either climatological or flow-dependent estimates. However, the finite size of the ensemble induces a sampling noise, which degrades the accuracy of the variance estimation. An idealized 1D framework is firstly considered, to show that the spatial structure of sampling noise is relatively small-scale, and is closely related to the background-error correlations.This motivates investigations on local spatial averaging, which is here applied to ensemble-based variance fields in this 1D context. It is shown that a spatial averaging, manually optimized, helps to significantly reduce the sampling noise. This provides estimates which are as accurate as those derived from a much bigger ensemble. The dependencies of this optimization on the error correlation length-scale and on the heterogeneity of the variance and length-scale fields are also illustrated. These results are next confirmed in a more realistic 2D problem, by considering the current operational version of the ArpÃ¨ge background-error covariance matrix.Finally, the possibility to objectively and automatically optimize the filtering is explored. The idea is to apply the usual linear estimation theory and to use signal/noise ratios in order to calculate an optimal filter. The efficiency of this objective filtering is illustrated in the idealized 1D framework. Copyright © 2008 Royal Meteorological Society},

  Abstract                 = {Flow-dependent background-error variances can be estimated by means of an ensemble of assimilations. However, the finite size of the ensemble implies a sampling noise, which is detrimental for the variance estimation. This article presents a filtering procedure for ensemble-estimated variance fields, which relies on an estimate of spectral signal/noise ratios.It is first demonstrated that the sampling noise covariance can be expressed analytically as a simple function of the background-error covariance. The resulting formula shows in particular that the spatial structure of the sampling noise is closely related to the spatial structure of background error (i.e. to its correlation function). It is then explained how this relation can be used to calculate an objective filter.Investigations are first conducted in a highly idealized 1D framework, to show that the proposed filter is able to remove most of the sampling noise, while extracting the signal of interest. Application to an ensemble of Météo-France Arpège forecasts is then considered. This objective filter reveals a vertical-level dependence, with a larger signal/noise ratio near the surface, and a scale separation between signal and noise which is more pronounced in altitude. The results also indicate that, after applying such an optimized filter, variance estimates obtained from a six-member ensemble have a residual estimation error variance around 10%.Some insights are then given into the spatio-temporal dynamics of the variance field. It is observed that the globally averaged background-error variance is fairly stable in time, while spatial patterns of the variance field are closely linked to the meteorological situation, with high values found in the vicinity of troughs.Finally, impact studies in the Arpège system show that the filtering of vorticity variances has a positive impact on the quality of the NWP system.

  Abstract                 = {Background-error variances estimated from a finite size ensemble of data assimilations are affected by sampling noise, which degrades the accuracy of the variance estimates. Previous work highlighted the close link between the spatial structures of background error and the associated sampling noise, and demonstrated the ability of local spatial averaging to remove this sampling noise.Existing filtering techniques commonly assume a homogeneous smoothing of the estimated variances. However, this assumption can be inadequate to represent error structures of varying scales, e.g. small-scale errors associated with localized severe weather events. To answer this problem, this article introduces and examines a heterogeneous filter based on the knowledge of the local spatial properties of the sampling noise. The filtering is realized with a diffusion process, and the diffusion coefficient is parametrized according to the local correlation length-scale of the sampling noise. This enables the diffusion coefficient to vary spatially in such a way as to encourage smoothing in regions where the background error is large scale in preference to regions where the error is small scale.A simulated 1D framework is considered to test the proposed approach. It is shown that the filtering using a spatially varying diffusion coefficient is able to preserve high-frequency variance structures, while this information tends to be smoothed with homogeneous filtering. The benefits of applying heterogeneous filtering are particularly pronounced with small ensemble sizes and in the vicinity of localized variance maxima.

The length-scales can be estimated from an ensemble of perturbed forecasts, however the finite size of the ensembles in operational applications introduces a relatively large sampling noise on the estimated length-scales.We first give some insight into the statistical properties of the noise. On the one hand, the noise variance can be analytically expressed as a simple function of the length-scale and the ensemble size. On the other hand, it is shown that the spatial structure of the noise is relatively small-scale and is directly related to the heterogeneity of background error.Such spatial properties tend to support the use of local averaging techniques to remove the noise. This is explored with the application of homogeneous and heterogeneous averagings based on the integration of the diffusion equation. It is observed that both filters improve the accuracy of the length-scale estimates, with the heterogeneous filter being more efficient in the regions where the length-scales are small and rapidly varying.

  Abstract                 = {Skillful low visibility forecasts are essential for air-traffic managers to effectively regulate traffic and to optimize air-traffic control at international airports. For this purpose, the COBEL-ISBA local numerical forecast system has been implemented at Paris CDG international airport. This local approach is robust owing to the assimilation of detailed local observations. However, even with dedicated observations and initialization, uncertainties remain in both initial conditions and mesoscale forcings. The goal of the research presented here is to address the sensitivity of COBEL-ISBA forecast to initial conditions and mesoscale forcings during the winter season 2002-2003. The main sources of uncertainty of COBEL-ISBA input parameters have been estimated and the evaluation of parameter uncertainty on the forecasts has been studied. A budget strategy is applied during the winter season to quantify COBEL-ISBA sensitivity. This study is the first step toward building a local ensemble prediction system based on COBEL-ISBA. The conclusions of this work point out the potential for COBEL-ISBA ensemble forecasting and quantify sources of uncertainty that lead to dispersion.},

  Abstract                 = {In Part I of this study an analytical model for a steady-state tropical cyclone is constructed on the assumption that boundary-layer air parcels are conditionally neutral to displacements along the angular momentum surfaces of the hurricane vortex. The reversible thermodynamics implied by this assumption allows the mature storm to be thought of as a simple Carnot engine, acquiring heat at the high-temperature ocean surface and losing heat near the low-temperature tropopause. Although the oceanic heat source is universally recognized as the sine qua non for the mature hurricane, there is also wide acceptance of conditional instability of the second kind (CISK) (which makes no specific reference to surface heat fluxes) as the formative mechanism. This ambivalence is seen in that all numerical-simulation studies find it essential to have transfer from the ocean surface yet all start from a conditionally unstable atmosphere. The hypothesis put forward in Part I, based on the steady-state theory, is that the truly important thermodynamic interaction, even in the developing star, is between vortex and ocean (as distinct from vortex and convection sustained by preexisting conditional instability as in the CISK theory) with cumulus convection rapidly redistributing heat acquired at the oceanic source upward and outward to the upper tropospheric sink. On this view, it is not the organization of convection that is needed per se, but the organization of surface heat flux. We have constructed a time-dependent nonhydrostatic axisymmetric numerical model with convection explicitly accounted for to examine this idea. The numerical experiments show that as a result of a finite-amplitude air-sea interaction instability a hurricane-like vortex may indeed amplify in an atmosphere which is neutral to cumulus convection and attain an intensity and structure which are in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions of Part I. We examine in detail the model&#39;s heat budget which confirms the crucial importance of boundary-layer processes in controlling the structure and evolution of the vortex. We also confirm the conjecture made in Part I that, within a large-scale limit, the horizontal size of the mature tropical cyclone is determined by that of the initial disturbance.},

  Abstract                 = {The use of perturbed observations in the traditional ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) results in a suboptimal filter behaviour, particularly for small ensembles. In this work, we propose a simple modification to the traditional EnKF that results in matching the analysed error covariance given by Kalman filter in cases when the correction is small; without perturbed observations. The proposed filter is based on the recognition that in the case of small corrections to the forecast the traditional EnKF without perturbed observations reduces the forecast error covariance by an amount that is nearly twice as large as that is needed to match Kalman filter. The analysis scheme works as follows: update the ensemble mean and the ensemble anomalies separately; update the mean using the standard analysis equation; update the anomalies with the same equation but half the Kalman gain. The proposed filter is shown to be a linear approximation to the ensemble square root filter (ESRF). Because of its deterministic character and its similarity to the traditional EnKF we call it the âdeterministic EnKFâ, or the DEnKF. A number of numerical experiments to compare the performance of the DEnKF with both the EnKF and an ESRF using three small models are conducted. We show that the DEnKF performs almost as well as the ESRF and is a significant improvement over the EnKF. Therefore, the DEnKF combines the numerical effectiveness, simplicity and versatility of the EnKF with the performance of the ESRFs. Importantly, the DEnKF readily permits the use of the traditional Schur product-based localization schemes.},

Beginning 9 May, the 0000 UTC analyses initialized 36-h Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) forecasts containing a large convection-permitting 4-km nest. These 4-km 3DVAR-, EnSRF-, and hybrid-initialized forecasts were compared to benchmark WRF forecasts initialized by interpolating 0000 UTC Global Forecast System (GFS) analyses onto the computational domain. While important differences regarding mean state characteristics of the 20-km DA systems were noted, verification efforts focused on the 4-km precipitation forecasts. The 3DVAR-, hybrid-, and EnSRF-initialized 4-km precipitation forecasts performed similarly regarding general precipitation characteristics, such as timing of the diurnal cycle, and all three forecast sets had high precipitation biases at heavier rainfall rates. However, meaningful differences emerged regarding precipitation placement as quantified by the fractions skill score. For most forecast hours, the hybrid-initialized 4-km precipitation forecasts were better than the EnSRF-, 3DVAR-, and GFS-initialized forecasts, and the improvement was often statistically significant at the 95th percentile. These results demonstrate the potential of limited-area continuously cycling hybrid DA configurations and suggest additional hybrid development is warranted.},

  Abstract                 = {Dual-resolution (DR) hybrid variational-ensemble analysis capability was implemented within the community Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model data assimilation (DA) system, which is designed for limited-area applications. The DR hybrid system combines a high-resolution (HR) background, flow-dependent background error covariances (BECs) derived from a low-resolution ensemble, and observations to produce a deterministic HR analysis. As DR systems do not require HR ensembles, they are computationally cheaper than single-resolution (SR) hybrid configurations, where the background and ensemble have equal resolutions.Single-observation tests were performed to document some characteristics of limited-area DR hybrid analyses. Additionally, the DR hybrid system was evaluated within a continuously cycling framework, where new DR hybrid analyses were produced every 6 h over ~3.5 weeks. In the DR configuration presented here, the deterministic backgrounds and analyses had 15-km horizontal grid spacing, but the 32-member WRF Model?based ensembles providing flow-dependent BECs for the hybrid had 45-km horizontal grid spacing. The DR hybrid analyses initialized 72-h WRF Model forecasts that were compared to forecasts initialized by an SR hybrid system where both the ensemble and background had 15-km horizontal grid spacing. The SR and DR hybrid systems were coupled to an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter that updated ensembles each DA cycle.On average, forecasts initialized from 15-km DR and SR hybrid analyses were not statistically significantly different, although tropical cyclone track forecast errors favored the SR-initialized forecasts. Although additional studies over longer time periods and at finer grid spacing are needed to further understand sensitivity to ensemble perturbation resolution, these results suggest users should carefully consider whether SR hybrid systems are worth the extra cost.},

New analyses were produced every 6 h between 0000 UTC 1 June and 1800 UTC 14 July 2010 over a domain encompassing the contiguous United States (CONUS) and adjacent areas. Additionally, a control experiment that only assimilated meteorological observations was performed. Each 1800 UTC analysis initialized a 48 h Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry model forecast. These forecasts were evaluated with a focus on air quality prediction. The ensemble aerosol spread was generally insufficient, particularly over the western CONUS. However, despite the suboptimal ensemble spread, the hybrid system performed quite well and usually produced the best aerosol forecasts. Additionally, both the 3DVAR- and EnSRF-initialized forecasts typically outperformed the control. These results are encouraging and suggest the resiliency of the hybrid method. Improved aerosol ensembles should translate into even better future hybrid forecasts.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent verification statistics show a considerable improvement in the accuracy of forecasts from three global numerical weather prediction systems. The improvement amounts to about a 1-day gain in predictability of mean-sea-level pressure and 500 hPa height over the last decade in the northern hemisphere, with a similar gain over the last 3 years in the southern hemisphere. Differences between the initial analyses from the three systems have been substantially reduced.Detailed study of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts verifications shows that identifiable improvements in the data assimilation, model and observing systems have significantly increased the accuracy of both short- and medium-range forecasts, although interannual (flow-dependent) variations in error-growth characteristics complicate the picture. The implied r.m.s. error of 500 hPa height analyses has fallen well below the 10 m level typical of radiosonde measurement error. Intrinsic error-doubling times, computed from the divergence of northern hemisphere forecasts started 1 day apart, exhibit a small overall reduction over the past 10 years at day two and beyond, and a much larger reduction at day one. Error-doubling times for the southern hemisphere have become generally shorter and are now similar to those for the northern hemisphere. One-day forecast errors have been reduced so much in the southern hemisphere that medium-range forecasts for the region have become almost as skilful as those for the northern hemisphere.The approach to saturation of forecast error beyond the 10-day range has been examined for sets of 21-day forecasts. When the systematic (sample-mean) component of the error is subtracted, forecast errors and the differences between successive forecasts both appear to level out near the end of the 21-day range at values close to the limit set by the natural level of variance of the atmosphere for the northern hemisphere. A number of features of the model 500 hPa height fields remain quite realistic at the three-week range. The most obvious discrepancy in mean climate is in the Pacific/North-American sector, and variance is too high in the southern hemisphere. Copyright © 2002 Royal Meteorological Society},

  Abstract                 = {Assimilation of Doppler radar data into cloud models is an important obstacle to routine numerical weather prediction for convective-scale motions; the difficulty lies in initializing fields of wind, temperature, moisture, and condensate given only observations of radial velocity and reflectivity from the radar. This paper investigates the potential of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which estimates the covariances between observed variables and the state through an ensemble of forecasts, to assimilate radar observations at convective scales. In the basic experiment, simulated observations are extracted from a reference simulation of a splitting supercell and assimilated using the EnKF and the same numerical model that produced the reference simulation. The EnKF produces accurate analyses, including the unobserved variables, after roughly 30 min (or six scans) of radial velocity observations. Additional experiments, in which forecasts are made from the ensemble-mean analysis, reveal that forecast errors grow significantly in this simple system, so that the ability of the EnKF to track the reference solution is not simply because of stable system dynamics. It is also found that the covariances between radial velocity and temperature, moisture, and condensate are important to the quality of the analyses, as is the initialization chosen for the ensemble members prior to assimilating the first observations. These results are promising, especially given the ease of implementing the EnKF. A number of important issues remain, however, including the initialization of the ensemble prior to the first observation, the treatment of uncertainty in the environmental sounding, the role of error in the forecast model (particularly the microphysical parameterizations), and the treatment of lateral boundary conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {The optimal utilisation of hyper-spectral satellite observations in numerical weather prediction is often inhibited by incorrectly assuming independent interchannel observation errors. However, in order to represent these observation-error covariance structures, an accurate knowledge of the true variances and correlations is needed. This structure is likely to vary with observation type and assimilation system. The work in this article presents the initial results for the estimation of IASI interchannel observation-error correlations when the data are processed in the Met Office one-dimensional (1D-Var) and four-dimensional (4D-Var) variational assimilation systems. The method used to calculate the observation errors is a post-analysis diagnostic which utilises the background and analysis departures from the two systems.The results show significant differences in the source and structure of the observation errors when processed in the two different assimilation systems, but also highlight some common features. When the observations are processed in 1D-Var, the diagnosed error variances are approximately half the size of the error variances used in the current operational system and are very close in size to the instrument noise, suggesting that this is the main source of error. The errors contain no consistent correlations, with the exception of a handful of spectrally close channels. When the observations are processed in 4D-Var, we again find that the observation errors are being overestimated operationally, but the overestimation is significantly larger for many channels. In contrast to 1D-Var, the diagnosed error variances are often larger than the instrument noise in 4D-Var. It is postulated that horizontal errors of representation, not seen in 1D-Var, are a significant contributor to the overall error here. Finally, observation errors diagnosed from 4D-Var are found to contain strong, consistent correlation structures for channels sensitive to water vapour and surface properties.},

  Abstract                 = {Four-dimensional variational assimilation (4DVAR) of noisy observations in a multi-layerquasi-geostrophic model is studied, in both the perfect and imperfect model settings. Withinthe perfect model setting, the quality of the assimilated state improves significantly when theassimilation period is extended more than one week into the past. Specifically, when observationsare supplied every 6 h, the squared error in the assimilated state at the end of the assimilationtime period (the present) saturates at a value two orders of magnitude smaller than theimposed observational error for an assimilation period of 10 days. Further, this reduction inerror occurs not only in measures explicitly minimized by 4DVAR, but for all standard measuresof error. For realistic levels of observational error, the extension of forecast lead times is large,exceeding 15 days for global forecasts when the assimilation period is 10 days. This holds evenfor weather regime transitions, which are shown to be predictable at lead times of 10 days. Theuse of long assimilation periods extends forecast lead times approximately 5 days over the casewhen assimilation periods are on the order of one day. The structure of the analysis error whenlong assimilation period 4DVAR is applied is examined. This error is primarily concentratedin the midlatitude storm tracks. The reduction in analysis error is increasingly efficient at smallscales as the assimilation period is increased; consequently, for long assimilation periods theanalysis error projects strongly into the subspace of the leading Lyapunov vectors. The performanceof 4DVAR in an imperfect model setting is also examined, and is found to depend uponthe growth rate of the model errors. For rapidly growing model errors, extension of the assimilationperiod beyond about 1–2 days results in a degradation in the quality of the assimilatedstate as well as in the forecast quality. However, for model error growth rates similar to thegrowth rates of the leading Lyapunov vectors of the system, improvements in the assimilatedstate similar to those found for the perfect model are obtained. As such, it is estimated thatassimilation times of 3–5 days for current levels of model error may improve the quality ofassimilated states and forecasts in an operational setting.},

It is shown how the âadjoint equationsâ of the model can be used to compute explicitly the âgradientâ of the distance function with respect to the model's initial conditions. the computation of one gradient requires one forward integration of the full model equations over the time interval on which the observations are available, followed by one backward integration of the adjoint equations. Successive gradients thus computed are introduced into a descent algorithm in order to determine the initial conditions which define the minimizing model solution.The theory is applied to the vorticity equation.

Two simulations were performed, one using a very high resolution and another with a vertical grid typical of current high-resolution mesoscale models. Both simulations were initialized with the same profiles, derived from observations from a fog field experiment. Significant differences in the onset and evolution of fog were found. The results obtained with the high-resolution simulation are in overall better agreement with available observations. The cooling rate before the appearance of fog is better represented, while the evolution of the liquid water content within the fog layer is more realistic. Fog formation is delayed in the low resolution simulation, and the water content in the fog layer shows large-amplitude oscillations. These results show that the numerical representation of key thermo-dynamical processes occurring in fog layers is significantly altered by the use of a grid with reduced vertical resolution.},

Examples are given showing that the diagram can be used to summarize the relative merits of a collection of different models or to track changes in performance of a model as it is modified. Methods are suggested for indicating on these diagrams the statistical significance of apparent differences and the degree to which observational uncertainty and unforced internal variability limit the expected agreement between model-simulated and observed behaviors. The geometric relationship between the statistics plotted on the diagram also provides some guidance for devising skill scores that appropriately weight among the various measures of pattern correspondence.},

  Abstract                 = {10.1002/qj.49711347714.abs The semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian integration technique enables numerical weather prediction models to be run with much longer timesteps than permitted by a semi-implicit Eulerian scheme. the choice of timestep can then be made on the basis of accuracy rather than stability requirements. to realize the full potential of the technique, it is important to maintain second-order accuracy in time; this has previously been achieved by applying it in the context of a three-time-level integration scheme. In this paper we present a two-time-level version of the technique which yields the same level of accuracy for half the computational effort. Unlike other efficient two-time-level schemes, ours does not rely on operator splitting. We apply this scheme to a variable-resolution barotropic finite-element regional model with a minimum gridlength of 100 km, using timesteps of up to three hours. the results are verified against a control run with uniformly high resolution, and are shown to be of similar accuracy to those of a semi-implicit Eulerian integration with a timestep of 10 minutes.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper contributes to the understanding of the structure functions used implicitly in the four-dimensional variational assimilation (4D-Var) developed at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in the last few years. The theoretical equivalence between 4D-Var and the Kalman filter allows us to interpret (after normalization by the error standard deviations) the analysis increments produced by one single observation as the structure functions used implicitly in 4D-Var. The shape of the analysis increments provides a three-dimensional picture of the covariances of the background errors, modified by the dynamics.We study a baroclinic situation and observations have been regularly distributed along a latitude circle crossing the baroclinic wave. Eight standard pressure levels have been considered to sample the vertical.The forecast error standard deviations and the structure functions implied in 4D-Var may differ considerably from those used in the 3D-Var analysis. Unlike 3D-Var, the structure functions are flow dependent: the effective background error standard deviation can be four times larger and the correlation length scale twice as short in the vicinity of a low. A meridional extension of the experimentation at the surface shows that the effective background error standard deviations at 1000 hPa are largest in the areas of strong pressure gradient.We quantify the link between the analysis increments produced by 4D-Var and the fastest growing perturbations over the same time interval. In the depression, the explained variance of the analysis increments by the first 13 singular vectors reaches 30%.The impact of the temporal dimension is assessed. A period of 24 hours seems a minimum for the increments to develop fully baroclinic structures.},

Both real and synthetic data sets were used to compare the Wiener estimator in the Fourier domain, soft thresholding, hard thresholding, and the EB wavelet-based estimators. Four synthetic data sets, originally designed by Donoho and Johnstone to isolate and mimic various features found in real signals, were corrupted with correlated Gaussian noise to test the various denoising methods. Quantitative comparison of the error between the true and estimated signal revealed that the wavelet-based methods outperformed the Wiener estimator in most cases. Also, the EB method outperformed the soft and hard thresholding methods in general because the wavelet representation is not sparse at the coarsest levels, which leads to poor estimation of the noise variance by the thresholding methods. Microseismic and streaming potential data from laboratory tests were used for comparison and showed similar trends as in the synthetic data analysis.},

In this paper, we study how model error could be accounted for in 4D-Var.We present three approaches for the formulation of weak-constraint 4D-Var: estimating explicitly a model-error forcing term, estimating a representation of model bias or, estimating a four-dimensional model state as the control variable. The consequences of these approaches with respect to the implementation and the properties of 4D-Var are discussed.We show that 4D-Var with an additional model-error representation as part of the control variable is essentially an initial-value problem and that its characteristics are very similar to that of strong constraint 4D-Var. Taking the four-dimensional state as the control variable, however, leads to very different properties. In that case, weak-constraint 4D-Var can be interpreted as a coupling between successive strong-constraint assimilation cycles. A possible extension towards long-window 4D-Var and possibilities for evolutions of the data assimilation system are presented. Copyright © 2006 Royal Meteorological Society},

  Abstract                 = {Incremental four-dimensional variational assimilation (4D-Var) is an algorithm that approximately solves a nonlinear minimization problem by solving a sequence of linearized (quadratic) minimization problems of the form $$\min_{\bf x} F[{\bf x}] = ^{{1}\over{2}}{\bf x}^{\rm {T}} {\bf A} {\bf x} - {\bf b}^{\rm {T}} {\bf x} + c,$$ where x is the control vector, A is a symmetric positive-definite matrix, b is a vector containing data and prior information, and c is a constant. This paper proposes a family of limited-memory preconditioners (LMPs) for accelerating the convergence of conjugate-gradient (CG) methods used to solve quadratic minimization problems such as those encountered in incremental 4D-Var. The family is constructed from a set of vectors {si : i = 1, …, l}, where each si is assumed to be conjugate with respect to the (Hessian) matrix A. In incremental 4D-Var, approximate LMPs from this family can be built using conjugate vectors generated during the CG minimization on previous outer iterations. The spectral and quasi-Newton LMPs employed in many operational 4D-Var systems are shown to be special cases of the family of LMPs proposed here. In addition, a new LMP based on Ritz vectors (approximate eigenvectors) is derived. The Ritz LMP can be interpreted as a stabilized version of the spectral LMP. Numerical experiments performed with a realistic global ocean 4D-Var system are presented, to test the impact of the three different preconditioners. The Ritz LMP is shown to be more effective than, or at least as effective as, the spectral and quasi-Newton LMPs in our 4D-Var experiments. Our experiments also demonstrate the importance of limiting the number of CG (inner) iterations on certain outer iterations to avoid possible divergence of the cost function on the outer loop. The optimal number of CG iterations will depend on the specific preconditioner used, and can be computed a priori, albeit at the expense of several evaluations of the cost function on the outer loop. In a cycled 4D-Var system, it may be necessary to perform this computation periodically to account for changes in the Hessian matrix arising from changes in the observing system and background-flow field.

  Abstract                 = {A wavelet formulation on the sphere is being considered for modelling heterogeneous background-error correlations for the MÃ©tÃ©o-France global numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. This approach is compared with the operational spectral formulation, which is horizontally homogeneous to a large extent. Diagnostic studies have been conducted to examine geographical variations of three-dimensional correlations over the whole globe. Results indicate that the contrast between relatively broad horizontal correlations in the Tropics and sharp ones in midlatitudes is well represented by the wavelet formulation. Heterogeneities in vertical correlations are also better captured in the wavelet approach than in the spectral one, with visible changes as functions of e.g. latitude and land/sea contrasts. In addition, wavelet-based correlation estimates are shown to be partly sensitive to the choice of the calibration period. The impact of the wavelet formulation on the forecast quality has been investigated during a three-week calibration period, and also during the following three weeks. While the impact of the wavelet formulation is globally positive during the two periods, it tends to be more spectacular during the calibration time interval, as expected. These results indicate that an on-line calibration should be considered in the future, in order to exploit fully the ability of wavelets to extract correlation heterogeneities from ensemble data.

  Abstract                 = {For data assimilation in numerical weather prediction, the initial forecast-error covariance matrix Pf is required. For variational assimilation it is particularly important to prescribe an accurate initial matrix Pf, since Pf is either static (in the 3D-Var case) or constant at the beginning of each assimilation window (in the 4D-Var case). At large scales the atmospheric flow is well approximated by hydrostatic balance and this balance is strongly enforced in the initial matrix Pf used in operational variational assimilation systems such as that of the Met Office. However, at convective scales this balance does not necessarily hold any more. Here we examine the extent to which hydrostatic balance is valid in the vertical forecast-error covariances for high-resolution models in order to determine whether there is a need to relax this balance constraint in convective-scale data assimilation. We use the Met Office Global and Regional Ensemble Prediction System (MOGREPS) and a 1.5 km resolution version of the Unified Model for a case study characterized by the presence of convective activity. An ensemble of high-resolution forecasts valid up to three hours after the onset of convection is produced. We show that at 1.5 km resolution hydrostatic balance does not hold for forecast errors in regions of convection. This indicates that in the presence of convection hydrostatic balance should not be enforced in the covariance matrix used for variational data assimilation at this scale. The results show the need to investigate covariance models that may be better suited for convective-scale data assimilation. Finally, we give a measure of the balance present in the forecast perturbations as a function of the horizontal scale (from 3-90 km) using a set of diagnostics.

  Abstract                 = {An ensemble Kalman filter?variational hybrid data assimilation system based on the gridpoint statistical interpolation (GSI) three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3DVar) system was developed. The performance of the system was investigated using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System model. Experiments covered a 6-week Northern Hemisphere winter period. Both the control and ensemble forecasts were run at the same, reduced resolution. Operational conventional and satellite observations along with an 80-member ensemble were used. Various configurations of the system including one- or two-way couplings, with zero or nonzero weights on the static covariance, were intercompared and compared with the GSI 3DVar system. It was found that the hybrid system produced more skillful forecasts than the GSI 3DVar system. The inclusion of a static component in the background-error covariance and recentering the analysis ensemble around the variational analysis did not improve the forecast skill beyond the one-way coupled system with zero weights on the static covariance. The one-way coupled system with zero static covariances produced more skillful wind forecasts averaged over the globe than the EnKF at the 1?5-day lead times and more skillful temperature forecasts than the EnKF at the 5-day lead time. Sensitivity tests indicated that the difference may be due to the use of the tangent linear normal mode constraint in the variational system. For the first outer loop, the hybrid system showed a slightly slower (faster) convergence rate at early (later) iterations than the GSI 3DVar system. For the second outer loop, the hybrid system showed a faster convergence.},

  Abstract                 = {An important element of a data assimilation system is the statistical model used for representing the correlations of background error. This paper describes a practical algorithm that can be used to model a large class of two- and three-dimensional, univariate correlation functions on the sphere. Application of the algorithm involves a numerical integration of a generalized diffusion-type equation (GDE). The GDE is formed by replacing the Laplacian operator in the classical diffusion equation by a polynomial in the Laplacian. The integral solution of the GDE defines, after appropriate normalization, a correlation operator on the sphere. The kernel of the correlation operator is an isotropic correlation function. The free parameters controlling the shape and length-scale of the correlation function are the products kpT, p = 1, 2, hellip, where (-1)pkp is a weighting (lsquodiffusionrsquo) coefficient (kp &gt; 0) attached to the Laplacian with exponent p, and T is the total integration lsquotimersquo. For the classical diffusion equation (a special case of the GDE with kp = 0 for all p &gt; 1) the correlation function is shown to be well approximated by a Gaussian with length-scale equal to (2k1T)1/2.The Laplacian-based correlation model is particularly well suited for ocean models as it can be easily generalized to account for complex boundaries imposed by coastlines. Furthermore, a one-dimensional analogue of the GDE can be used to model a family of vertical correlation functions, which in combination with the two-dimensional GDE forms the basis of a three-dimensional, (generally) non-separable correlation model. Generalizations to account for anisotropic correlations are also possible by stretching and/or rotating the computational coordinates via a lsquodiffusionrsquo tensor. Examples are presented from a variational assimilation system currently under development for the OPA ocean general-circulation model of the Laboratoire d'Oceanographie Dynamique et de Climatologie.},

Solutions to the isotropic diffusion problem on both the spherical space \documentclass{article}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{amsfonts}\pagestyle{empty}\begin{document}${\mathbb S}^2$ \end{document} and the d-dimensional Euclidean space \documentclass{article}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{amsfonts}\pagestyle{empty}\begin{document}${\mathbb R}^d$ \end{document} are considered first. In \documentclass{article}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{amsfonts}\pagestyle{empty}\begin{document}${\mathbb R}^d$ \end{document} the correlation functions implied by explicit diffusion are approximately Gaussian, whereas those implied by implicit diffusion belong to the larger class of Matérn functions which contains the Gaussian function as a limiting case. The Daley length-scale, defined as \documentclass{article}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{amsfonts}\pagestyle{empty}\begin{document}$D=\sqrt{-\! \left.d/\nabla^{2} c(r)\right|_{r=0}}$ \end{document} where ?2 is the d-dimensional Laplacian operator and r = |r| is Euclidean distance, is used as a standard parameter for comparing the different isotropic functions c(r).

As a result, fundamental parameters that define the correlation model on \documentclass{article}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{amsfonts}\pagestyle{empty}\begin{document}${\mathbb S}^2$ \end{document} can be specified using more convenient expressions available on \documentclass{article}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{amsfonts}\pagestyle{empty}\begin{document}${\mathbb R}^2$ \end{document}.Anisotropic Gaussian or Matérn correlation functions on \documentclass{article}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{amsfonts}\pagestyle{empty}\begin{document}${\mathbb R}^d$ \end{document} can be represented by a diffusion operator furnished with a symmetric and positive-definite diffusion tensor.

Relationships between this tensor, which we call the Daley tensor, and the diffusion tensor of the explicit and implicit diffusion operators are established. Methods to estimate the elements of the local Daley tensor from a sample of simulated background errors are presented and compared in an idealized experiment with spatially varying covariance parameters. Since the number of independent parameters needed to specify the local diffusion tensor is of the order of the total number of grid points N, sampling errors are inherently much smaller than those involved in the order N2 estimation problem of the full correlation function. While the correlation models presented in this paper are general, the discussion is slanted to their application to background-error correlation modelling in ocean data assimilation.

Different methods are proposed for solving the 2D implicit diffusion problem and these are compared with respect to their efficiency, accuracy, memory cost, ease of implementation and parallelization properties on high-performance computers. The methods described in this article are evaluated in a global ocean VDA system. An iterative algorithm based on the Chebyshev iteration, which uses a fixed number of iterations and pre-computed eigenvalue bounds, is shown to be particularly promising.

The errors were inflated to account indirectly for known inter-channel error correlations. This is sub-optimal as it artificially down-weights observations from these instruments. The true nature of these correlations for IASI are estimated here using data from the Met Office 4D-Var assimilation scheme and a posteriori diagnostics based on analysis and background departures. The diagnosed matrices are symmetrised and reconditioned, to make them suitable for use in the operational assimilation scheme. These matrices have been tested in full assimilation experiments. The results of these experiments show that using the new matrices improves forecast accuracy due to more weight in the assimilation being given to the IASI observations, particularly those from water-vapour-sensitive channels.},

  Abstract                 = {The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a data assimilation scheme based on the traditional Kalman filter update equation. An ensemble of forecasts are used to estimate the background-error covariances needed to compute the Kalman gain. It is known that if the same observations and the same gain are used to update each member of the ensemble, the ensemble will systematically underestimate analysis-error covariances. This will cause a degradation of subsequent analyses and may lead to filter divergence. For large ensembles, it is known that this problem can be alleviated by treating the observations as random variables, adding random perturbations to them with the correct statistics.Two important consequences of sampling error in the estimate of analysis-error covariances in the EnKF are discussed here. The first results from the analysis-error covariance being a nonlinear function of the background-error covariance in the Kalman filter. Due to this nonlinearity, analysis-error covariance estimates may be negatively biased, even if the ensemble background-error covariance estimates are unbiased. This problem must be dealt with in any Kalman filter&#8211;based ensemble data assimilation scheme.A second consequence of sampling error is particular to schemes like the EnKF that use perturbed observations. While this procedure gives asymptotically correct analysis-error covariance estimates for large ensembles, the addition of perturbed observations adds an additional source of sampling error related to the estimation of the observation-error covariances. In addition to reducing the accuracy of the analysis-error covariance estimate, this extra source of sampling error increases the probability that the analysis-error covariance will be underestimated. Because of this, ensemble data assimilation methods that use perturbed observations are expected to be less accurate than those which do not.Several ensemble filter formulations have recently been proposed that do not require perturbed observations. This study examines a particularly simple implementation called the ensemble square root filter, or EnSRF. The EnSRF uses the traditional Kalman gain for updating the ensemble mean but uses a &#8220;reduced&#8221; Kalman gain to update deviations from the ensemble mean. There is no additional computational cost incurred by the EnSRF relative to the EnKF when the observations have independent errors and are processed one at a time. Using a hierarchy of perfect model assimilation experiments, it is demonstrated that the elimination of the sampling error associated with the perturbed observations makes the EnSRF more accurate than the EnKF for the same ensemble size.},

  Abstract                 = {Daisyworld is a simple planetary model designed to show the long-term effects of coupling between life and its environment. Its original form was introduced by James Lovelock as a defense against criticism that his Gaia theory of the Earth as a self-regulating homeostatic system requires teleological control rather than being an emergent property. The central premise, that living organisms can have major effects on the climate system, is no longer controversial. The Daisyworld model has attracted considerable interest from the scientific community and has now established itself as a model independent of, but still related to, the Gaia theory. Used widely as both a teaching tool and as a basis for more complex studies of feedback systems, it has also become an important paradigm for the understanding of the role of biotic components when modeling the Earth system. This paper collects the accumulated knowledge from the study of Daisyworld and provides the reader with a concise account of its important properties. We emphasize the increasing amount of exact analytic work on Daisyworld and are able to bring together and summarize these results from different systems for the first time. We conclude by suggesting what a more general model of life-environment interaction should be based on.},

  abstract = { AbstractThe performance of (ensemble) Kalman filters used for data assimilation in the geosciences critically depends on the dynamical properties of the evolution model. A key aspect is that the error covariance matrix is asymptotically supported by the unstableâneutral subspace only, i.e. it is spanned by the backward Lyapunov vectors with non-negative exponents. The analytic proof of such a property for the Kalman filter error covariance has been recently given, and in particular that of its confinement to the unstableâneutral subspace. In this paper, we first generalize those results to the case of the Kalman smoother in a linear, Gaussian and perfect model scenario. We also provide square-root formulae for the filter and smoother that make the connection with ensemble formulations of the Kalman filter and smoother, where the span of the error covariance is described in terms of the ensemble deviations from the mean. We then discuss how this neat picture is modified when the dynamics are nonlinear and chaotic, and for which analytic results are precluded or difficult to obtain. A numerical investigation is carried out to study the approximate confinement of the anomalies for both a deterministic ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and a four-dimensional ensemble variational method, the iterative ensemble Kalman smoother (IEnKS), in a perfect model scenario. The confinement is characterized using geometrical angles that determine the relative position of the anomalies with respect to the unstableâneutral subspace. The alignment of the anomalies and of the unstableâneutral subspace is more pronounced when observation precision or frequency, as well as the data assimilation window length for the IEnKS, are increased. These results also suggest that the IEnKS and the deterministic EnKF realize in practice (albeit implicitly) the paradigm behind the approach of Anna Trevisan and co-authors known as the assimilation in the unstable subspace. },
